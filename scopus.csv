If the unions' power is sufficiently high, all bargaining units choose to negotiate over wages alone, i.e., universal right-to-manage bargaining emerges in equilibrium. Otherwise, wage/employment bargaining and right-to-manage bargaining coexist in the same industry. In equilibrium, some firm-union pairs will always choose to bargain over employment as well, since the firms become Stackelberg leaders in the market by committing to a particular output during the negotiations. The firms and their unions both benefit from the additional Stackelberg rents, provided that the unions' power is small enough. Our analysis suggests that there is not necessarily a negative relationship between unions' power and sectoral employment rates.","Decentralized bargaining; J50; J53; L13; Oligopoly; Scope of bargaining; Stackelberg leader; Unions","Article","Scopus"

Since organizations are becoming flatter, culturally rich, geographically diverse and intensely competitive, the possibilities for conflict in such environments are greater. Negotiation is an important aspect of a project and plays an important role in resolving claims, preventing disputes, and keeping a harmonious relationship between project participants. Part of any project manager’s role as a leader is to recognize conflict, understand the sources of conflict and manage it, and to do this a project manager must be able to understand the basics of negotiation theory and have sufficient competencies to lead in such situations. To address the complex technical and human issues in negotiation, different negotiation theories and models are available which mainly include game theory, economic theory, and behavior theory. Since Game Theory provides, by its very nature, the appropriate tools for the analysis and eventual solution of conflicts of any kind, this paper uses a model based on Game Theory in order to identify the activities that are responsible for the delays in a project and divide the costs among them. © 2015, SciKA.","Conflict; Game Theory; Negotiation; Project management","Article","Scopus"

From 1980 to today, HR management has shifted into a strategic function of the company. The globalisation, digitalisation and techno-focus of the modern workplace is at the centre of a new organizational design, and with change comes resistance, particularly for employees who see this new design as a threat to their positions. For people to keep up with technology, HR management must evolve to embrace these changes. Through a student-led perspective, leadership experts Jon-Arild Johannessen and Helene Sætersdal discuss how the HR department can develop to face the challenges of the 21st Century, including new roles and functions to create an ambidextrous organisation. With 51 reflection tasks throughout, Johannessen and Sætersdal help students explore how to reduce resistance to organisational change and create a healthy work environment, through techniques such as mindfulness, negotiation, and enthusiasm. This is an ideal read for any student of management and leadership looking to understand the challenges HR departments are facing, and how they can help change the way the game is played for the future of work. © 2019 Emerald Publishing Limited.

The study is underpinned by the system approach to leadership and a transdisciplinary framework which, strives for a flexible management system through greater interaction between leaders and their relevant stakeholders in organizational decision processes. Seventeen (17) cases were drawn from diverse organizational settings within public and private sectors of Ghana (Africa) to empirically demonstrate how networks in leadership proffer solutions to “ill-structured” and “moderately structured” challenges that confront organizations. The study observes that wicked problems are inevitable in organizations. We conclude that efforts at building bridges between leaders and their environment are not only good for human relations per se but remain the “lifeblood” for organizational breakthroughs, especially, in situations of critical challenges that involve complex decisions. The study concludes that although leaders may be well endowed in knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs), organizational issues in most cases go beyond familiar issues and from the ‘ordinary’ to ones that are subtle, complex, extraordinary, and sophisticated in nature and in most cases requiring social capital to liaise between the organization and other actors for successful negotiations and resolutions, not ‘quick-fix solutions’. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cases; Flexibility; Leadership; Networks; Transdisciplinary; Wicked problems","Article","Scopus"

Executive trainings for managers and leadership programs for publicly elected officials, public managers, and nongovernmental organizations frequently include negotiation modules. These efforts, however, have yet to reach community leaders who also need to develop their negotiation skills. We propose that members of disadvantaged low-income communities who lack educational and economic opportunities, and are less able to advocate for their own interest, need to build and strengthen their civic capacity, including their negotiation skills, to become more effective parties to decisions affecting them. While many professionals and executives have access to training, such opportunities are less accessible to the leaders of these disadvantaged communities. Although such leaders draw from their own heuristic knowledge, skills, and abilities, they could also benefit from sharpening their negotiation skills. We propose that the multidimensional understanding of their community that members accumulate through direct experience is indispensable, nontransferable to outsiders, and not teachable through in-class activities. Leaders with the ability to leverage knowledge and assets to connect effectively to community insiders as well as to outside people, institutions, and resources, however, possess some specific inherent personality traits as well an understanding of social structures, strategies, and agency, which can be taught and learned. Such skills as how to conduct negotiations around the table and away from it and how to identify community members who can help and how to rally them are also teachable. The cases were chosen to illustrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that make these leaders effective in and beyond their communities. We highlight those KSAs that we think are teachable in the framework of a negotiation module in community leadership training to enhance civic capacity for community betterment. © 2009 President and Fellows of Harvard College.","Civic capacity building; Leadership in disadvantaged communities; Negotiation executive training","Article","Scopus"

The research challenges many of the orthodoxies of educational managerialism. For example: the use of leadership teams made up of teachers, coordinators and senior school leaders reflected a commitment to distributive leadership and very flat leadership structures in each of the schools (rather than 'line management' structures); the leadership teams promoted key values as the driving force for reform (rather than leader inspired 'visions of reform'); leadership teams used non-linear and evolutionary planning approaches that were negotiated closely with participants (rather than 'strategic planning' approaches to goal setting driven by school leaders); and the main process vehicles used by leadership teams to further their schools' reform work were local action research and regular, dedicated staff workshops (rather than directives and accountability regimes). The paper analyses local school reform initiatives through a micropolitical frame. It is argued that micropolitical knowledge and insight is critical to the development of school practices that use the 'positive politics' of negotiation, collaboration and conflict resolution to address issues of local concern in schools, rather than the 'controlling politics' of new managerialism.","","Review","Scopus"

The Declaration of Santiago reaffirmed the commitment issued at the Miami Summit of the Americas in December 1994 to conclude the talks 'no later than 2005, and to make concrete progress by the end of the century'. Negotiations began in earnest in Miami in September 1998 and trade ministers will meet in Toronto in early November 1999 to assess the progress to date. The FTAA process has had a star-crossed history since its inception at the Miami Summit in December 1994. Each summit meeting has been followed by serious financial crises in the region. These problems have tested national resolve to sustain economic and political reforms and to move forward with new Hemisphere-wide trade liberalisation. But each crisis also has induced new economic reforms, particularly in exchange rate regimes and the financial sector, and the reforms have enabled countries in Latin America to adapt more quickly to rapidly changing developments in global markets. In sum, the challenge of integration in the Americas is great, but so is its promise. In 1999, with recession in Latin America deepening, it is easy to be pessimistic about the prospects for the FTAA. Yet medium-term prospects for the region are encouraging, in large measure due to tremendous opportunities created by a decade of economic and political reforms. The Santiago Summit got the process off to a good start. The leaders formally launched the negotiations, established nine working groups to address the broad agenda of trade issues, and agreed on administrative procedures to manage the cumbersome process of engaging 34 countries in detailed trade negotiations. In addition, the leaders made two important decisions: to hold another summit hosted by Canada in 2001 or 2002; and to assign the United States and Brazil as co-chairs of the final two years for the FTAA negotiations, giving the leading economies in North and South America key responsibility for completing the deal. The manner of setting the stage does not ensure a prize-winning play; but at least the leaders are planning for success.","","Article","Scopus"

Its aim is to instruct readers on the way to use negotiation to lead effectively. For far too long conventional wisdom has proposed that strong leaders refuse to negotiate, viewing negotiation as a sign of weakness. Leading people requires charisma, vision, and a commanding presence, not the tricks for making deals. For many executives, negotiation is a tool to use outside the organization to deal with customers, suppliers, and creditors. Inside the organization, it's strictly ""my way or the highway."" Salacuse explains that leaders can increase their effectiveness by using negotiation in each of the three phases of the leadership lifecycle: 1) leadership attainment, 2) leadership action; and 3) leadership preservation and loss. Drawing on experience in wide variety of settings, including the author's own leadership positions, the book will examine high profile leadership cases such as the rise and fall of Carly Fiorina at Hewlett-Packard, the skillful negotiations by Warren Buffet to save Salomon Brothers from extinction, and the successful efforts by the partners at Goldman Sachs to negotiate a new vision and direction for that financial giant. Leaders and managers should pick up this book to learn how effective negotiation is essential to both gaining and exercising leadership and to overcoming threats to a leader's position. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.

In times of increased liberalization, deregulation and privatization of many former state-dominated tasks, limited institutional capabilities of smaller communities, a lack of consolidated government bodies and low effectiveness of authorities, there exists a greater interest for non-state ‘place-based’ economic engagement in general, and for private-sector involvement and leadership in regional governance in particular.

It also explores dominant discourses related to the masculine construction of leadership, women’s domestic responsibilities and women as enablers, which have a significant impact on women’s professional lives and upon the ways in which they are positioned. It notes that women’s narratives are shot through with ambiguity as they may inhabit several contradictory identities revealing qualities, characteristics and leadership styles which diverge from socially prescribed gender-appropriate behaviours. The article suggests that although there may appear to be a variety of identities from which women may select, there are limits to agency.

It first applies insights from political science and economics to the Israeli-Palestinian context, deriving hypotheses that are then tested using survey data from Israel and Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) collected between 1996 and 2001. Findings show that economic orientations have both a direct and indirect impact on attitudes toward negotiations and compromise. On one hand, economic evaluations are directly related to foreign policy attitudes through what appear to be cost-benefit calculations regarding the expected economic consequences of peace. Economic judgments also influence attitudes toward peace indirectly by contributing to levels of confidence in political leaders, which in turn influence the way that citizens assess the peace negotiations in which their leaders are engaged.","","Article","Scopus"

The interviews of five women from male-dominated colleges (greater than 50 percent male faculty-MD) and five from female-dominated fields (FD) were analyzed. For further study, the texts of the four women from healthcare colleges were compared with the six from non-healthcare fields. Interviewees were asked questions about their background, leadership and power. Confidentiality was adhered to according to the university's IRB guidelines and policies. Findings: The social world of the healthcare Deans was evident and was shaped around a ""rigid hierarchy of authority and power"" that goes beyond gender and is stratified among health-related professions.

In Agile, self-organizing teams work in short cycles called ""sprints"" and develop the features to enable the product to continuously evolve in the light of the experience they gain and through customer feedback. Design/methodology/approach: For insight into how Agile is being implemented at a leading software services firm with clients in hundreds of industries, Strategy & Leadership asked Rob Purdie, Agile Practice Lead for the IBM Design Lab, how Agile software development methods were contributing to the success of IBM's key digital marketing initiatives. Findings: The traditional approach to software development is to define, design, develop and test everything - before delivering anything. With Agile, managers can reduce waste by prioritizing features based on relative business value, evaluating and re-designing as the project proceeds. Practical implications: Agile requires leaders and teams to work and learn through problems, designs and options in an open and transparent environment. It places new demands on technical leaders in terms of negotiation and planning skills. Originality/value: Managers outside the software industry should note that Agile/Scrum is likely to be increasingly essential to the future of product development and manufacturing. Nowadays many products for consumers and businesses include embedded software systems, so developing products in the future will require deeper collaboration across multiple engineering disciplines and marketing teams and familiarity with the Agile approach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agile software development; Continuous innovation; IBM Design Lab; Product development; Scrum","Article","Scopus"

It represents a moral commitment and an instrument for increasing trust and legitimacy. However, secrecy can still aid leaders by safeguarding their power and policies or preserving their reputation. This article examines Theresa May’s attempted use of secrecy around the UK–EU Brexit negotiations to protect her power, policy, and reputation between 2016 and 2019. While this approach appeared successful initially, over time, the counter-pressure for openness reversed its benefits. By the beginning of 2019, it was clear that May’s secrecy had limited her power, undermined her policy, and ultimately damaged her reputation. The analysis ends by drawing comparisons with Donald Trump, whose efforts to conceal his actions have produced the same counterproductive results. The case study illustrates how secrecy can create political space and bolster a leader’s reputation in the short term; however, over time, secret-keeping encourages leaks and greater scrutiny, exposes policies, and damages reputations, especially in increasingly transparent governance systems such as in the United States and the UK. Context is key, and secrecy surrounding high-profile, controversial issues, such as Brexit, is difficult to preserve. It can prove particularly damaging when it is tied to the leader’s reputation, as in May’s case. © 2019, © 2019 American Society for Public Administration.","Brexit; leadership; legitimacy; secrecy","Article","Scopus"

With regard to agricultural policies in Japan it is stressed that: (1) structural reform in Japanese agriculture is essential to promote the WTO agricultural negotiations and to make negotiations on FTAs more effective and prompt; (2) Japan must consider various measures to increase the investment of capital from outside agriculture and the accumulation of new human capital; and (3) there should be increased market competition in Japanese agriculture so that productive resources can be better concentrated in efficient farms and farm businesses. On international issues, it may be desirable to establish an international forum, particularly among Asian countries, to discuss important agricultural issues in the region. This forum should consider not only agricultural tariff reductions, but also sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures that might be addressed in working toward a broader FTA in Asia. The objective would be for Japan to play a strong leadership role in seeking wider cooperation on agricultural policies and agricultural resource management together with potential FTA partners in the Asian region. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","Conference paper","Scopus"

This paper argues that this current antipathy to trade is unsurprising: support for US leadership of the regime has always rested on a precarious balance among domestic interests. To overcome a historic bias in favor of home market production, American leaders created incentives for exporters to organize while creating roadblocks for import-competing firms and their employees. The dominance of the exporters' voice had a significant influence on the policies the US pursued in the design and execution of the global trade regime. Most importantly, the absence of labor's voice undermined the prospect for embedded liberalism and instead resulted in an anemic system of adjustment for job loss at home and limited support for worker interests within the regime. While policymakers' decision to shift power away from potential veto groups may have been necessary for US leadership of the Liberal International Order, this institutional design undermined a robust response to the economic dislocation thought to be a result of globalization. The result was a fracturing of the coalition in support of American leadership in the GATT/WTO regime. © The IO Foundation, 2021.","compensation; negotiation; trade; United States","Conference paper","Scopus"

Systematic effects of gender on negotiation are best predicted by situational characteristics that cue gendered behavior or increase reliance on gendered standards for agreement. In this review, we illuminate two levers that heighten or constrain the potential for gender effects in organizational negotiations: (a) the salience and relevance of gender within the negotiating context and (b) the degree of ambiguity (i.e., lack of objective standards or information) with regard to what is negotiable, how to negotiate, or who the parties are as negotiators. In our summary, we review practical implications of this research for organizational leaders and individuals who are motivated to reduce gender-based inequities in negotiation outcomes.

In contrast, when division managers are evaluated using a cooperative performance evaluation scheme, leadership tone does not significantly affect the likelihood that divisions settle on an equal-profit transfer price.

The developed methodology relies on a system of methods, the main of which are an online survey, content analysis and a focus group using the Likert method. The article for the first time summarized the experience on the implementation of a unified transnational campaign in the subsections of the Russian Federation (RF), evaluated the existing mechanisms used in social protection interests of workers. The analysis of the subjective and objective factors allowed the authors to reveal that the increase in the efficiency of the unified translational complex is impeded the desire for independence and independence of a number of trade union leaders. In the negative sector was the implementation of agreements (regional and sectoral). It requires the development of awareness of trade union functionaries. In the interests of increasing the efficiency of the negotiation process, it was proposed to improve the information system for providing trade union leaders; social protection issues should be addressed at their own levels. The main advantage of the article is that it points to the substantial dependence of the negotiation process on the subjective factor - trade union leaders. It is important to encourage them to conduct comprehensive work in the framework of the implementation of the basic principles of the negotiation campaign, focusing on the increase in wages, the subsistence minimum and the need to strengthen control, both from trade unions and from government bodies. The development of trade union leaders should focus on gaining knowledge and practical experience in negotiating, studying the regulatory framework. At the same time, they need to learn how to enlist the support of the team from the higher authorities. The harmonious development of all elements of the negotiation process will serve as a guarantee of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of social partnership. © 2019 by author(s).","Efficiency; Leaders; Negotiations; Social dialogue; Social partnership; Social sphere; Trade union","Article","Scopus"

These leadership events can then be managed to align the event meanings of others with yours. This requires the use of persuasion and negotiation to influence the other actors in the network and to endorse your leadership. This actor network is sustained using active communication and reinforcement to achieve the common goals.

In equilibrium, as a proposer becomes close to certain of its opponent’s type, the duration and intensity of war goes to 0. We then test whether increase in leader tenure decrease the duration of militarized interstate disputes. Our estimates indicate that crises involving new leaders are 25.3 percent more likely to last one month than crises involving leaders with four years of tenure.

Taking as their example the introduction of the Modern Matron in the English National Health Service (NHS) this paper considers how new forms of gender transcending leadership are constituted relationally through a dynamic interplay of historical, nostalgic, social, political and organizational forces. The research was conducted within an interpretive paradigm of social constructivism and draws on data from semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 16 Modern Matrons working in a single English NHS Trust. In keeping with inductive, qualitative research practice, data has been analysed thematically and ordered using descriptive, hierarchical and relational coding. Their contention is that the Modern Matron presents as a site for relational leadership in respect of both self and other. This paper argues that the construction of Modern Matron usefully points to the ways in which multiple discourses, practices and relations may be intertwined in defining what it is to lead in contemporary organizations. This paper highlights the extent to which leadership is an on-going relational co-construction based – in this instance – in the interplay of four factors: nostalgic authority, visibility, praxis and order negotiation. Together, these produce a mode of leading that is neither heroic nor popularist. Further research might consider how competing temporal, political and organizational imperatives encourage the development of particular sites for leadership, and how such leadership is then re-performed in practice, as well as the affects/effect on individual and organisational performance. The data provides opportunity to consider the “lived experience” of leaders in sites that are traditionally gendered female in non-standard/public sector settings. Moreover, this paper presents empirical evidence in support of leadership as socially constructed and relational, borne of tension between different temporal, spatial and experiential factors, the on-going negotiation of which both utilises and transcends masculinized and feminized gender performances. The result is a form of “leading” which is often subtle, difficult to identify and self-effacing. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Gender; Healthcare; Leaders; Leadership; Leading; Managing; Matrons; Nostalgia; Nurses; Organization; Praxis","Article","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach: Two experimental negotiation studies (n1 = 138, n2 = 128) were conducted at a US university. Findings: This paper presents three original and noteworthy findings: One, in mixed-gender negotiations, as a dyad’s TGR endorsement increases, final agreements become significantly more likely to favor men than women. Two, in mixed-gender negotiations, TGR endorsement is significantly associated with a decreased ability to establish a pleasant, mutually satisfactory and successful business relationship, resulting in a possible future economic cost due to lost opportunity. Three, the heightened relationship conflict during the negotiation mediates the negative association between TGR endorsement and women’s economic outcomes. Research limitations/implications: Empirical findings support social role theory, role congruity theory and gender role conflict theory. The use of a distributive negotiation case and laboratory research methodology may limit the generalizability of findings. Practical implications: Findings about the detrimental effects of TGR in mixed-gender negotiations magnify the importance of becoming aware of our TGR orientations and their potential negative consequences on our long-term collaborations. Also, it is necessary to provide negotiation trainings to both genders with regard to gender-driven conflicts and offer tools to prevent or tackle such conflicts. Social implications: Negotiations are among the most consequential of social interactions as their results have a substantial impact on individuals’ careers and financial outcomes. Understanding the effect of TGRs is paramount to improve female representation, participation and effectiveness in management and leadership. Mixed-gender negotiations such as collective equality bargaining, workplace social interactions, work-life balance discourse are critical to establishing gender equality and fairness in organizations and societies. Originality/value: Understanding how gender influences negotiation processes and outcomes and using the findings to improve both genders’ negotiation success are crucial to establishing fairness and equity in society and business. This research attempts to close a gap in the literature by focusing on the potential function of gender role orientation in explaining gender differences in negotiation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gender conflict; Mixed-gender negotiation; Role incongruity; Subjective outcomes; Traditional gender roles","Article","Scopus"

Our results readily extend to Bertrand competition, however. Like Prusa (1992), we consider two types of negotiated agreements: (i) firms do not face any constraints and can raise the price to whatever level necessary to maximise their joint profits, and (ii) firms are restricted so as to hold the price at the level that would prevail if anti-dumping duty, assessed at the preliminary stage by the ITA, was imposed. The key explanation we identify for why, depending on parameters, the outcome may be either anti-dumping duty or a price negotiation is based on asymmetric information. We first show that if the firms are free to negotiate an agreement, under complete information, they will always reach a price agreement and the home firm will choose to terminate the investigation. We then demonstrate that if the firms' information sets differ, they may fail to come to an agreement on price and the case may run its entire course and result in an anti-dumping duty. For example, if one firm knows whether the assessed duty will be high or low while the other does not, the negotiation may or may not materialise. We also identify one case, principally of theoretical interest in which even with perfect information anti-dumping duty outcome may obtain. This case arises if the home firm is a Stackelberg leader and negotiations are constrained such that the price cannot exceed that under anti-dumping duty. It turns out that in this case, given the limit on the price, the home firm cannot improve its position beyond what it is able to do by exploiting its market power as a leader. A key feature of the paper is its intuitive, diagrammatic approach. We are able to demonstrate all our results in the output space using the familiar reaction-curves diagram. In this respect, our approach is different from that of Prusa (1992) which carries out the analysis in the profit space thereby relegating the key choice variables of the firms to the background.","","Article","Scopus"

In the South African context, student representative councils (SRCs) at universities is an important mechanism to ensure that all South African students receive quality higher education in a safe, disciplined and healthy environment, that is underpinned by access, success and equity which are critical areas of focus in the transformation process. SRCs, as a well organized body, with the necessary skills can channel their capability and commitment toward improving university life for students. As Fullan (1993:182) argues that we hardly know anything about what students think about educational change because no one ever asks them. A student leadership initiative can be a potential for change in universities, since students as the ""guardians of the existing culture can be the final arbiters of any change” (Wideen, 1992: 182). Further, by harnessing SRCs as potential reinforcers for improvement, there is more concern with the process through which successful change can be introduced in universities. Since SRCs are vested with the authority to contribute to good governance within universities, students place their trust in it. Therefore, SRCs need the requisite skills to make decisions that do not compromise the interests of students whom they represent. The study aimed to examine student perceptions and expectations of leadership through democratic deliberation at the Durban University of Technology (DUT), in partnership with the International Centre on Non Violence (ICON) and The African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Conflicts (ACCORD). The student leadership course was a pioneer initiative for student leaders, comprising of local and international students studying at DUT. The rationale for this was the identified need for focused research into what student leaders perceive leadership to be and the value they derive from attending leadership initiatives. The partners felt it important to document student voices through a leadership initiative. The narrative, through a qualitative analysis, captured the contradictions and conflicting challenges student leaders face today, which are always problematic and dynamic, especially when public interests are not at the forefront of the agenda. Students stated that the course was beneficial, because it helped to: focus on purpose and goals of being SRC members; understand cultural diversity; show more interest in developing leadership skills as a collective; gain a sense of clarity of personal and university values; gain improved negotiation, conflict resolution and decision making skills; deal better with complex issues; and willing are able to use leadership practices for the benefit of all stakeholders. It is ultimately envisaged that the leadership initiative will be extended beyond the frontiers of DUT to other local, national and possibly international higher education institutions. As part of an on-going series of courses relating to student leadership, it is expected that such initiatives with the university partners will strengthen the effectiveness of student leaders, thereby contributing to the process of higher education transformation. © 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.","Higher Education; Leadership; Personnel Training","Article","Scopus"

Although the withdrawal was seen at the time as serving the interests of both the Israeli government and the Palestinians, we argue that the same result could not have been achieved through bilateral negotiations. ""Behind-the-table"" internal conflicts on each side would have made it impossible for the leaders to agree on the scope of these negotiations. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's success in implementing his Gaza withdrawal was attributable in significant measure to his ability to maintain ambiguity about his long-run plans for the West Bank. Only by focusing attention on Gaza was he able to build the necessary coalition to implement the controversial move. The Palestinian leaders, on the other hand, could never have agreed to come to the table to negotiate about Gaza alone - they would have insisted that the scope of any negotiations address a broad range of final status issues. In this article, we identify some of the lessons that the Gaza example teaches regarding the utility and limits of unilateralism as well as the benefits and potential costs of employing ambiguity as a strategy to help accomplish a controversial move. Finally, we also explore the aftermath of the withdrawal and its many missed opportunities for improving the outcome. We suggest that, even when acting unilaterally, leaders should carefully consider the probable impact of their actions on the internal conflicts of their adversaries. © 2014 President and Fellows of Harvard College.","Ambiguity; Ariel Sharon; Behind-the-table negotiations; Conflict; Gaza; Israel; Negotiation; Palestinians; Settlers; Unilateralism; West Bank","Article","Scopus"

Drawing on social exchange theory, we hypothesise that low-quality supervisor–employee relationships (i.e., leader–member exchange) are more likely to result in unsuccessful task-related i-deal negotiations, which consequently might provoke increased organisational cynicism. We analysed three waves of data from 202 Swiss bankers who had requested task-related i-deals within the investigated business cycle. The results supported our hypothesis.

Our study empirically draws on a rare leadership development workshop bringing together chief executives and frontline leadership to explore the complexities of leadership in a health and safety context. This inquiry draws iteratively between workshop interactions and subsequent interviewing of those present to identify discursive resources firstly hindering and secondly contributing to moments of pluralising and spreading leadership. Whereas frontline leadership drew on discourses of embedding, collaborative and grounding leadership, and chief executives alternatively on analytic, overseeing and cascading discourses, our interest was provoked by the shared discursive resources of reframing identities, constructing intermediaries, overcoming distance, sparking engagement and inviting translation with the potential to loop hierarchy and bring power relations across hierarchical differences into (re)negotiation. © The Author(s) 2019.","Discourse; hierarchy; leadership; plural leadership; power; spreading leadership","Article","Scopus"

Employees often make changes to their work roles, such as by negotiating their job responsibilities and seeking challenging tasks. In this study, we suggest that role-making behaviours influence and are influenced by the dyadic relationship between leaders and employees, otherwise known as leader–member exchange (LMX). We collected three waves of survey data from a sample of Chinese employees who were recent college graduates (n = 203). The results from cross-lagged panel analyses showed that (1) LMX and job-change negotiation were reciprocally related to each other and (2) initial LMX was associated with increased challenge-seeking behaviours, although these behaviours did not lead to greater LMX later on. In addition, we found evidence that when employees experienced a high level of emotional ambivalence (a conflicting, mixed and complex emotional state), the direct and reciprocal relationships between LMX and role-making behaviours were weakened. Our findings advance the understanding of the development of leader–employee relationships in the workplace and have implications for strengthening employee perceptions of high-quality relationships with their leaders by making changes to their workplace roles. © The Author(s) 2022.","emotional ambivalence; leader–member exchange; reciprocal relationship; role-making behaviours; self-reinforcing","Article","Scopus"

The degree to which salespeople defend prices should critically depend upon their leaders’ influence. However, the influence of leadership on salespeople’s price defense behavior is barely understood, conceptually or empirically. Therefore, building on social learning theory, the authors propose that salespeople might adopt their leaders’ price defense behavior given a transformational leadership style. Furthermore, drawing on the contingency leadership perspective, the authors argue that this adoption fundamentally depends on three variables deduced from the motivation–ability–opportunity (MAO) framework, that is, salespeople’s learning motivation, negotiation efficacy, and perceived customer lenience. Results of a multi-level model using data from 92 salespeople and 264 salesperson–customer interactions confirm these predictions. The first to explore contingencies of salespeople’s adoption of their transformational leaders’ price negotiation behaviors, this study extends marketing theory and provides actionable guidance to practitioners. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science.","Leadership; Price negotiations; Sales; Salesperson–customer interaction; Social learning; Transformational leadership","Article","Scopus"

This paper addresses leadership as relational work, traced in interactions between a principal and a group of teachers operating within the context of a school-improvement project in a Norwegian upper secondary school. The analysis explores how the participants position themselves and others through negotiations in meetings while the participants discuss the conditions of the project. The findings show how leadership positions and power relations are constituted, challenged and changed in interaction amongst the participants over time. Thus, this study provides insight into leadership as an interactive process and the dynamics of power and trust in developing leadership actions. The main argument is that risks and opportunities are significant parts of leadership work, and that relational work affects the ever-changing status of the division of authority. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Article","Scopus"

As in many jurisdictions, bargaining had developed in a way that produced a great deal of conflict, characterized by frequent and lengthy impasses, a grievance backlog that reached 1,400 arbitration cases and a public and political leadership that was losing patience. This jointly written article illustrates how change can begin, the role of statewide leadership, the resulting work behind the scenes and the possibilities. Since 1992, the Wisconsin Department of Employment Relations and the state's largest labor union, the 27,000-member Wisconsin State Employees Union (WSEU), have successfully used ""consensus bargaining."" This cooperative, problem-solving approach contrasts sharply with the traditional adversarial and confrontational approach to bargaining. Consensus bargaining focuses on identifying and meeting bargainers' interests and creating a positive and constructive basis for discussions. This problem-solving approach has created more cooperative labor-management relations in Wisconsin State Government, reduced bargaining time, stimulated creative new contract provisions and helped develop a more positive and closer labor-management relationship. There are several keys to successful consensus negotiation: management and union leaders must be committed to the process; leaders must model cooperative behavior; bargainers should receive formal training in the process; negotiators must be candid throughout bargaining; and management and labor have to realize that reaching agreement on a contract is the beginning, not the end of creating a cooperative relationship. Wisconsin State Government, the WSEU, and other state employee unions have successfully used the consensus process and are committed to this cooperative approach.","","Article","Scopus"

We advance Emotions as Social Information (EASI) theory, which posits that emotional expressions exert interpersonal effects by triggering affective reactions and/or inferential processes in targets, depending on the target’s information processing and the perceived appropriateness of the emotional expression. We review evidence from four domains of organizational behavior: customer service, group decision making, negotiation, and leadership.

The effects of these variables were examined in stratified groups, where a leader established inequitable pay-rates, and subordinates could coalesce and destroy a portion of the leader's outcomes. The results showed that status differences (as opposed to status similarity) undermined the sense of common interests between subordinates and reduced the severity of coalitional action against the leader. Face-to-face negotiations engendered a more cautious approach to coalition negotiations and also reduced the severity of insurgent action.

To develop this proposition the article integrates literature on conflict resolution and conflict transformation with models of negotiation and underscores the potential utility of historical acknowledgment strategies in early stages of official negotiations. The article proposes that historical acknowledgment strategies address the lack of long-term trust, which is often a significant impediment during negotiations. Such strategies signal a commitment to changing the public space as well as the education of future generations in ways that acknowledge the adversary’s history and identity. This action is likely to provide assurances to the other side that peaceful coexistence is a long-term goal of the leadership and the public. Furthermore, the article proposes that the current international normative environment—that is, existing human rights norms and strengthening international norms of “dealing with the past”—places expectations and demands on states’ leadership. These expectations and demands are part of the constraints and pressures within which a conflict operates and within which any peace process is negotiated. Therefore, the current international normative environment makes the positive effects of incorporating historical acknowledgment strategies into early peace negotiations more likely. To illustrate the feasibility of the rationale developed here and its practical implications, the article considers the application of historical acknowledgment strategies to the case of Israel/Palestine and specifically to the 1948 Palestinian refugees issue. © 2020 President and Fellows of Harvard College","acknowledgment; historical justice; Israel/Palestine; negotiation; Palestinian refugees; recognition; signaling","Article","Scopus"

When women do negotiate, they ask for too little, they are too willing to accept early offers, and they are too quick to accommodate. As a result, women are repeatedly disadvantaged in salary, developmental opportunities, and other resources that they need for successful careers. In this chapter, we consider whether women-focused negotiation training might offer a gendered solution to the gendered problems that women face in workplace negotiations. Historically, negotiation training has focused on best practices that are treated as gender-blind. In contrast, women-focused negotiation training assumes that gender matters a great deal. Guided by the same principles that underlie recommendations for women-focused leadership development programs, we investigate how gender colors and influences each stage of a successful negotiation: the pre-negotiation preparation and groundwork, the during-negotiation behaviors and dialogue, and the post-negotiation persistence. The chapter delivers a framework that outlines the what(content) and the how(delivery) that might constitute a women-focused negotiation training course. We expand the portfolio of trained behavior to include skills, strategies and tactics that might be particularly and even uniquely relevant to female negotiators. © Editors and Contributors Severally 2020.

Though research directly exploring potential influences of gender in this context remains scarce, work on gender and trust in other areas suggests that whether and how trust develops and subsequently affects negotiation outcomes may differ substantially for men and women. This chapter begins by describing the status of the literature on trust and negotiation, highlighting the current focus on understanding the basic relationship between trust and important bargaining outcomes. It next discusses research on gender and trust from related domains (e.g., behavioral economics, leadership), and argues that negotiator gender is a critical aspect of understanding when and how trust makes a difference at the bargaining table. In the remainder of the chapter, a framework to guide future research is outlined, emphasizing the need to move beyond the consideration of trust as a static construct. Focusing instead on trust dynamics, or when and how trust changes throughout a negotiation, is expected to highlight important gender differences that might not otherwise be apparent. © Editors and Contributors Severally 2020.

Extant research focuses on specific process and resource options to address responsiveness, with only limited reference to managers' capabilities in adapting to new organization designs that organize processes and resources. Consequently, organizational theory that characterizes the implications of developing and implementing various designs is ignored. The study directly leverages organization adaption, organization design and the dynamic managerial capabilities literature to address the question of how to improve SC responsiveness. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative data are used to identify specific dynamic managerial capability constructs, as well as the expected relationships depicted in our conceptual model. The authors test these relationships using quantitative survey data collected from 199 SC leaders. Findings: The authors find that capabilities in organization design, functional leader negotiations and workforce communications foster SC responsiveness via improved structural adaptability (SA). The findings explain how and when organization design actions impact SA and responsiveness, and more importantly, why managers should invest in developing a workforce communication capability as the foundation for organizational adaptability.

Findings: Identity negotiation is a key issue and lesbians face the constant pressure of identity management. This is not simply a personal perspective but a defence mechanism to counter the heteronormative culture within organisations. Strategies for dealing with these tensions evident in the literature and reflected in this study range from ""passing"" (passing as a heterosexual) to defying expectations of heteronormativity and remaining constant to individual butch identity.

Social implications: The findings here will be of interest to social audiences including LGBT individuals, activist groups and support groups. Wider understanding of female masculinity and butch identity may help leverage greater tolerance and acceptance.

The research is based on a specific approach to action research aimed at revealing the inherently masked conflictive energy, and contributing to a more sustainable, peaceful and well-performing construct. Design/methodology/approach: The framework is a specific approach to participatory action research that the authors call socio-economic intervention research. Findings: The results of the research support the proposition that while charismatic leadership quells conflict and jeopardizes the sustainability of the organization, socio-economic intervention research can help transform conflicts into cooperation in this type of organization. Originality/value: The main contributions relate to shedding light on the hazards of denying conflict in charismatic-led organizations, and the importance of systemic negotiation in transforming conflict into cooperation in the Middle Eastern cultural context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action research; Charismatic leadership; Conflict management; Conflict transformation; Inspection and certification body; Middle East; Organizational development; Socio-economic intervention research","Article","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on qualitative research using the deductive approach. Integrating the theoretical and empirical material in the analysis is used to enhance the readers’ value and interest in the paper. Findings – Without deep understanding of why some international negotiations related to climate change have previously failed, it is difficult to successfully negotiate them in the future. Flexibility and openness during negotiations and to consider the views and concerns of all global actors in finding optimum solutions and cooperation are among the many essential factors that bring the world leaders into a compromise agreement and a global climate change regime. Knowledge management including taking into account the discussed factors may help the negotiators and public to be more prepared to understand the obstacles that may complicate negotiating the international climate change regimes. Research limitations/implications – This paper is not intended for those who have years of experience in climate change negotiations nor for those seeking deep theoretical knowledge about this topic. Practical implications – This paper has practical implications as it combines the theories of international relations with practical evidences from previous Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Social implications – This paper is an essential read to students and young scientists, as well as to young policy-makers within the environmental politics. Originality/value – The paper deals with a very important and current issue and little has been published on the process of preparation for negotiating climate change negotiation.

Servant leadership emphasizes love and fundamental human values by embracing the conflicting parties and utilizing parallel dialogue and negotiations, which ultimately lead to sustainable peace. This study aimed to understand the effectiveness of servant leadership in conflict management. The study used a qualitative approach, using focus group discussion (FGD) and an in-depth survey to collect primary data from the Military Ordinariate of Indonesia. The results indicate that the implementation of leadership styles serving the Indonesian Military Ordinariate has undergone a shift in the perspective of conflict management from a security approach that results in grief and tears to a humanistic and humanitarian approach that prioritizes dialogue and negotiation based on love and mutual respect.

While customer-oriented salespeople create value for customers that enables them to reduce price concessions, they may overly focus on customers’ needs and, in doing so, hesitate to defend against such requests. Results of two quantitative studies and one preliminary qualitative study reveal that customer-oriented salespeople do not unconditionally benefit from their created value in price negotiations with customers. That is, salespeople effectively leverage their created value to negotiate prices with customers only if their sales managers instill confidence that high prices are justified.

Although the typologies, benefits and the challenges in such partnerships have been studied in the past, the problem of lack of clarity of leadership roles along with the effects of leadership qualities necessary for sustaining PPPs between TUs and industry in Ghana persists, as it has not been well considered. In this paper, we investigate the leadership roles that sustain PPPs among TUs and related industries in Ghana. A conceptual model is proposed to identify leadership roles for sustaining PPPs between TUs and industry. Questionnaires were administered to 418 respondents selected using the stratified random sampling technique. Among these, data was gathered from 320 respondents who completed questionnaires. Having obtained 77% value for Cronbach Alpha to confirm reliability and acceptance of data, further statistical analysis was performed to obtain results for this study. In particular, descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were employed to determine the extent of relationships among the variables in the model. The results of the study revealed that leadership roles of negotiation skills, networking, planning, and monitoring significantly contributed to the sustainability of PPPs in TUs. Overall, the study suggests that leadership of TUs and industries should effectively carry out the roles of negotiation, planning, networking, monitoring, and evaluation in order to achieve sustainable partnerships. © 2021, The European Higher Education Society.","Industry; Leadership; Public–private partnership; Sustainable partnership; Technical universities","Article","Scopus"

In this paper, a term frequency-inverse document frequency word cloud, a network similarities index, machine learning-processed latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and structural equivalence are applied to examine the meanings of the speeches. The main arguments in this paper are as follows. First, the document similarity between the speeches of Chinese and US leaders appears to be completely different. Also, while the documents from Chinese leaders are considerably similar, the documents from US leaders differ by far. Secondly, LDA topic analysis indicates that China concentrates more on international and collaborative relationships, while the U.S. has more focus on domestic and economic interests. Third, from a word hierarchy analysis, the basic words used by American and Chinese leaders are also completely different. Agriculture, farmers, automobiles, and negotiations are the basic words for American leaders, but for Chinese leaders, the basic words are planning, markets, and education. © 2019 Jungseok Research Institute of International Logistics and Trade, All rights reserved.","Official speeches; Text mining; TF-IDF; Topic analysis; Trade; Word hierarchy analysis","Article","Scopus"

Industry actors and policy makers alike rely upon partnerships and alliances for developing and growing sustainable business organizations and ventures. As a result, global business leaders must be well-versed in managing and leading multidimensional human relationships and business networks - requiring skill and expertise in conducting the negotiation processes that these entail. After laying out a foundation justifying the importance of studying negotiation in a global context, this book will detail conventional and contemporary theories regarding international engagement, culture, cultural difference, and cross-cultural interaction, with particular focus on their influence on negotiation. Building on these elements, the book will provide a broad array of country-specific chapters, each describing and analyzing the negotiation culture of businesspeople in a different country around the world. Finally, the book will look ahead, with an eye towards identifying and anticipating new trends and developments in the field of global negotiation. This text will appeal to scholars and researchers in international business, cross-cultural studies, and conflict management who seek to understand the challenges of intercultural communication and negotiation. It will provide trainers and consultants with the insights they need to prepare their clients for intercultural negotiation.

To make sense of this diversity, we investigate and diagram the role of power in CL. First, we identify six representations of power—six ways in which scholars have found that power shapes the emergence and enactment of CL. These representations include: Even in CL, individual power matters; Leaders can devolve power to their subordinates by empowering them; Contextual characteristics related to power can influence the possibility and enactment of CL; CL can create the collective power necessary for people in marginalized positions to challenge embedded power dynamics; Power is intrinsic to the co-construction process; Attributions affect who can enact CL, how they are viewed, and whether they have power. Second, we offer a conceptual framework that provides a comprehensive way to understand the relationship between power and CL. The framework includes two dimensions, one related to power (that runs from episodic to systemic) and the other related to CL (that runs from entitative to emergent). Third, we create a conceptual map by placing the six representations within this framework. Based on our research, we make the case that we cannot understand CL without understanding the ubiquitous, complex, and even contradictory role of power. We also suggest avenues for expanding and elaborating discussions of power in the CL literature. © 2022 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","Article","Scopus"

Across four studies, we show that men with greater facial width-to-height ratios are less cooperative negotiators compared to men with smaller facial ratios. This lack of cooperation allows men with greater facial width-to-height ratios to claim more value when negotiating with other men, but inhibits their ability to discover creative agreements that benefit all negotiating parties.

The analysis demonstrates that the Task Force 50 set out to forge unity among the EU27 by exercising both subtle instrumental and direct political leadership. The Commission significantly influenced the outcome of the negotiations by shaping the agenda and process, brokering deals, and ultimately achieving a withdrawal agreement that all member states signed up to. Its transparent and consultative behaviour generated trust among member states, which allowed the Commission to play such a prominent role. These findings challenge the prevailing view that the EU has become increasingly intergovernmental at expense of the Commission.

A new form of strategic change management method was designed and implemented to empower these tacit social logics to generate change. The hermeneutic dynamic of social logic revealed a predisposition for change at the operational level and a change resistance at the managerial level. The collective leadership is generated from the social logics of transformation and innovation within the social structure. In this business case, the collective leadership enables organisational change and innovation and becomes a new strategic change management challenge. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Change implementation; Collective leadership; Human capital; Innovation; Social logics; Strategic change management","Article","Scopus"

Even if negotiations succeeded, however, a binding treaty could not be ratified or implemented in many nations due to inadequate public support for emissions reductions. The scientific consensus on the reality and risks of anthropogenic climate change has never been stronger, yet public support for action in many nations remains weak. Policymakers, educators, the media, civic and business leaders, and citizens need tools to understand the dynamics and geopolitical implications of climate change. The WORLD CLIMATE simulation provides an interactive role-play experience through which participants explore these issues using a scientifically sound climate policy simulation model. Participants playing the roles of negotiators from major nations and stakeholders negotiate proposals to reduce GHG emissions. Participants then receive immediate feedback on the implications of their proposals for atmospheric GHG concentrations, global mean surface temperature, sea level rise, and other impacts through the C-ROADS (Climate Rapid Overview and Decision Support) policy simulation model used by negotiators and policymakers. The role-play enables participants to explore the dynamics of the climate and impacts of proposed policies using a model consistent with the best available peer-reviewed science. WORLD CLIMATE has been used successfully with students, teachers, business executives, and political leaders around the world. Here, we describe protocols for the role-play and the resources available to run it, including C-ROADS and all needed materials, all freely available at climateinteractive.org.

The empirical study consists of media texts and company media releases in Finland in 2012–2013. The main conclusions are that there are distinctive features in the co-operation negotiations that enable and enforce the possibility of management-by-fear, and thus destructive leadership. The process, supported by law and very much against the original aim, enhances authoritative leadership, objectification of employees, distortion of information and misleading, and the negative consequences thereof. The process is an employer-invited discursive dance where the employee has to follow through the set steps and in the set rhythm, with the media orchestrating the tune and managing the fear. The study adds a valuable element to the research areas of downsizing, bad management, and the discursive construction of these phenomena. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Co-operation negotiations; Critical interpretation; Discourse; Downsizing; Finland; Management-by-fear; Media","Article","Scopus"

Results indicate that the Porto Maravilha project has transposed business concepts to public administration. Today, the keynote lies in the attraction of new enterprises and in the construction of urban revitalization projects for the city’s makeover. With regard to the leadership, although public leadership has apparently adopted management instruments for decentralizing management and for public participation, these measures were not enough to achieve an effectively shared leadership that would reflect the multiple interests of different actors (as the theory of relational leadership presupposes). Thus, a set of contradictions and dilemmas for the leaders is apparent, among them: how to build an effectively-shared leadership, as every urban transformation project depends on the negotiation and complex interaction between different social actors?. © 2015, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

There have been many scholarly assessments but few empirical reconstructions of decision-making on the intergovernmental ESM and its predecessor the European financial stability facility. The instruments clearly constituted a step away from supranational entrepreneurship and the Community method. However, we question the intergovernmentalist interpretation in terms of institutional competition and decline. Using a historical analogy of the Delors model(s), we identify two types of institutional leadership and show how the ESM was characterized, first by an uneasy combination and then a shift from political championship to the engineering type of leadership. Using two case studies, we trace the negotiations for increasing the size and scope of the ESM. The analyses show that this was a bottom-up process in which the institutions laid out the tracks and provided the link between the control room (European Council) and ‘machine room’ (Eurogroup/Eurogroup Working Group/ Task Force on Coordinated Action) proceedings. © 2019 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Economic and monetary union; EU institutions; European integration; European stability mechanism; leadership","Article","Scopus"

This study examines the perceptions, actions, and decisions of union and district leaders using social movement theory to describe, analyze, and interpret contentious contract negotiations in three school districts in the Pacific Northwest region of the US. Research Methods: Having failed to arrive at a contract settlement mid-August prior to the beginning of the 2006-2007 school year, union and district leaders were approached and invited to participate in the study. Twenty-seven semi-formal interviews as well as observations of meetings and events, and artifacts were gathered for analysis. Findings: The article discusses key issues relevant to the ways union and district personnel perceived, spoke to, and engaged in labour conflict. Five action frames labeled craftsmanship, stewardship, competition, solidarity, and diplomacy were identified. The frames expose organizational logics and ideologies that appeared to guide how participants planned, managed, and communicated with each other and their constituents.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 275 employees working in 39 companies responded to a self-administered questionnaire. To test the research hypotheses, the methodology of structural equation models was used. Findings: The results show that the relationship between before hiring negotiations and i-deals is stronger for those individuals who had low self-worth, due to countervailing forces created by their belief that they may not be eligible for i-deals. In contrast, the relationship between after hiring negotiations and i-deals is stronger for those who had high self-worth, due to their belief that they were entitled to i-deals. Additionally, the research highlights that the relationship between i-deals and employee reactions is stronger for those organisations, which are high on TLB. Research limitations/implications: The data does not allow for investigating dynamic causal inferences, because they were collected using a questionnaire at a single point in time, and they were reported in retrospect, raising measurement concerns about recall bias. Practical implications: From a managerial point of view, the findings of this study inform that in negotiating both employment conditions and work arrangements, organisations should try to achieve i-deals that are primarily flexibility focused, and that in increasing efficiency organisations should make the employees feel well supported in order to develop more confidence in deploying skills and abilities to address a more open view of their i-deals. Originality/value: The study contributes to our understanding about the Indian hospitality industry by utilising the self-enhancement theory in examining whether individual differences moderate the relationship between the timing of negotiations and i-deals, and also by utilizing the social exchange theory to examine whether TLB moderates the relationship between i-deals and employee reactions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee reactions; Idiosyncratic deals; India; Self-evaluation; Timing of negotiations; Transformational leadership","Article","Scopus"

This article suggests a new explanation for these inconsistencies. We first note that a given TMT is likely to face a variety of different situations over time. Thus, while TMT demographic composition is relatively stable, the TMT task is dynamic and variable. In some situations, team members have similar information and interests (a symmetric distribution); in others, information or interests diverge (an asymmetric distribution). Based on team effectiveness theory, we argue that, unless group process is managed accordingly, asymmetric distributions of situation-specific information and interests will reduce TMT decision-making effectiveness. We then develop leader process choices to mitigate the potentially harmful effect of these asymmetries. These arguments form the basis of a theoretical model of TMT effectiveness that integrates insights from research on leadership, TMTs, small group process, and negotiation, and has practical implications for how leaders of senior teams can improve team effectiveness through appropriate process choices. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The author approaches the text from a managerial rather than a religious perspective to see what lessons can be derived that might have application and relevance for managers of contemporary organizations. The paper treats Moses' charge to free his people from bondage as a job offer and promotion, and examines why the offer was initially rejected by the candidate. Themes that are examined in the paper include the importance of clarifying authority for leaders, the importance of communication skills in the case, how teamwork is arranged to compensate for Moses' own perceived shortcomings, and how Moses gives notice to his current employer. The paper takes a careful look at Moses' negotiation skills, and at the importance of carefully matching the man to the mission. Additional lessons in leadership and management are examined throughout the paper. © Common Ground, Ira J.

Integral to DFAT’s post-Bali strategy was its decision to seek the collaborative support of the Australian outbound travel industry leadership to broaden dissemination of travel advisories to outbound Australian travellers. Although initial contacts between DFAT and the Australian travel industry leaders in early 2003 were contentious, subsequent negotiations resulted in the world’s first signed agreement between a foreign ministry and a national travel industry leadership in June 2003. The initial agreement, the Charter for Safe Travel involved the Australian travel industry’s commitment to disseminate DFAT travel advisories in exchange for a viable consultative role in their content. Australia’s collaborative model was adopted in the UK from 2004, in Canada from 2005 and New Zealand since 2016. Globally, consultation between national travel industry leaders and national foreign ministries is rare, despite the support of the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the World Travel and Tourism Council and the Pacific Asia Travel Association. Through participant observation research, in the context of collaboration and stakeholder theories, this article discusses the evolution of a consultative relationship between DFAT and the Australian outbound travel industry leadership and other relevant stakeholders between 2003 and 2017. The observations made in this study reveal that collaborative consultation has achieved positive changes to travel advisories which feature regionally specific, timely and comprehensible content. These qualitative enhancements have been complemented by enhanced dissemination of Australian government travel advisories. Australia’s Consular Consultative Group serves as a working model for similar collaboration, in the interests of global tourism safety. © The Author(s) 2018.","Collaboration; government travel advisories; government travel industry consultation","Article","Scopus"

At the same time, healthcare systems are transitioning from a multiprofessional model approach of healthcare delivery to an interprofessional model. The concurrence of these two trends may represent an opportunity for leaders in healthcare because both require renegotiation of the complex division of work and enhanced interdependency. This review examines how the introduction of new technologies alters the role boundaries of occupations and interdependencies among health occupations. Based on a scoping review of ethnographic studies of technology implementation in a variety of contexts (from primary care to operating room) and of diverse technologies (from health informatics systems to robotics), we develop the concept of role reconfiguration to capture simultaneous adjustments of multiple, interdependent roles during technological change. Ethnographic and qualitative studies provide rich, detailed accounts of what people actually do and how their work and role is changed (or not) when a new technology arrives. Through a synthesis of these studies, we develop a typology of four types of role reconfiguration: negotiation, clarification, enlargement and restriction. We discuss leadership challenges in managing role reconfiguration and formulate four leadership priorities. We suggest that leaders: redesign roles proactively, paying attention to interdependencies; offer opportunities for collective learning about new technologies; ensure that knowledge of new technologies is distributed across roles and prepare to address resistance.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Its role in the development of the climate change regime, as well as the adoption of novel policy instruments such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in 2005, are frequently put forward as indicative of a determination to push the international climate agenda forward. However, there are numerous instances where the EU has failed to achieve its climate change objectives (e.g. the 2009 Copenhagen Conference of the Parties). It is therefore important to examine the reasons behind these failures. This book explores in detail the involvement of the EU in international climate talks from the late 1980s to the present, focusing in particular on the negotiations leading up to Copenhagen. This conference witnessed the demise of the top-down approach in climate change policy and dealt a serious blow to the EU’s leadership ambitions. This book explores the extent to which negotiation theory could help with better comprehending the obstacles that prevented the EU from getting more out of the climate negotiation process. It is argued that looking at the role played by problematic strategic planning could prove highly instructive in light of the Paris Agreement. This broad historical perspective of the EU’s negotiations in international climate policy is an important resource to scholars of environmental and European politics, policy, law and governance. © 2017 Stavros Afionis.","","Book","Scopus"

The Connectedness Decision Paradigm (CDP) is a formal, general systems-spirituality framework, technology-supported, for group decision and negotiation (GDN) and leadership in making ""right"" decisions. A right problem/solution is validated by a spiritual rationality validation test involving connectedness. A participant (agent) may experience connectedness with purposes (intended results). Purposes for which there is reciprocated (shared) purpose connectedness across agents constitute common ground for these agents. A basic idea is to identify and expand such common ground. Even in difficult problem solving, as with polarization, where there seems to be little or no common ground, a priori there is always the ultimate purpose common ground of connectedness with One (spirituality) from which other common ground as connectedness with the ""other"" can arise. Common ground can lead to additional common ground and to an agreed problem solution-itself constituting common ground-that can be tested for rightness. Our focus here is on human agents considered as spiritual purposeful complex adaptive systems in multiagent environments. The ideas are applicable to other agents with lesser or greater capabilities than humans according to their capabilities. Expanding earlier work, this commentary on CDP is also based on GDN 2012, 2013 meeting remarks by the author, as well as on a lecture, ""Hope on the Edge of Chaos: The New Connectedness Paradigm in World Affairs"", Hamilton Hall, Salem, Massachusetts, February 2012. In presenting CDP, this commentary is also a call for problem solving frameworks for GDN and leadership, and solutions to world problems. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Connectedness Decision Paradigm; Group decision; Leadership; Multiagent systems; Negotiation; Right decisions; Spiritual rationality; Systems-spirituality; World problems","Article","Scopus"

Ferrin, Michelle C. Bligh and Jeffrey C. Kohles INTRODUCTION Dyadic trust research typically focuses on trustee behaviours and characteristics that earn, maintain, or repair another’s trust, and/or on trustor perceptions, beliefs, and intentions toward a trustee. This approach of understanding trust as a dyadic trustor-trustee phenomenon can be seen in trust’s foundational literatures of game theory (Deutsch, 1958) and close relationships (Rempel et al., 1985), and in more contemporary research on leader-follower trust (Dirks and Ferrin, 2002), trust between work colleagues (McAllister, 1995), trust between groups (Serva et al., 2005), relationships between participants in laboratory studies (Schweitzer et al., 2006), and negotiation studies (Maddux et al., 2008), among others. In most real-life dyadic relationships, each party acts simultaneously as both trustor and trustee. For instance, in a leader-follower dyad, the leader will typically behave in ways that earn or damage the follower’s trust while at the same time forming his or her own beliefs about the follower’s trustworthiness. And the follower will behave in ways that earn or damage the leader’s trust while at the same time forming beliefs about the leader’s trustworthiness. In contrast to this simultaneous reality of trust, empirical studies typically assign one party to report as trustor and the other as trustee. For instance, a typical field study might measure followers’ trust in their leader and assess whether that can be predicted with leader behaviours and characteristics. Why is there such a disconnect between trust as a real-life phenomenon and trust…. © Fergus Lyon, Guido Möllering and Mark Saunders 2012.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

Conflict negotiation literature indicates that the impact of leadership is particularly relevant to peace processes as leaders have to find a balance between war and peace. Still, little is known about the political leaders in charge. This study deals with the development of a political leader’s leadership in peace initiatives. It uses an in-depth case study of Colombia’s former President Juan Manuel Santos combining leadership and conflict negotiation literature to trace back the origins of his leadership. Santos, a controversial figure, represented a policy of reconciliation to negotiate with the opponents while also appearing tough in order to maintain his political base. Between hawk and dove, he initiated and signed the peace negotiation and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016. I adopt a personal biography approach using biographical data to explore the origins of Santos’ beliefs and values, his competence and skills and the way others perceived him. Linking this leadership-centred argument with findings from the conflict negotiation suggests that a pragmatic and reconciliation-oriented leadership might be relevant to find solutions to protracted conflicts like the one in Colombia. Most importantly, it contributes to a significant claim: Leaders have at least some level of choice and their biographical factors are relevant for political outcomes. © The Author(s) 2020.","biographical data; Colombia; Juan Manuel Santos; peace process; Political leadership","Article","Scopus"

The complex negotiations are presented as resolving issues of political, democratic and administrative concerns. It is argued that the balance of power on critical constitutional issues lay with the leaders of the consolidatory unions, particularly the dominant activist groups within such unions.

The purpose of this paper is to develop seven steps that might be needed for negotiators to become more responsible. These steps take into account the people at the table, but also those behind and beyond the table, and those needed to sign, ratify and also implement the deal. A broad responsibility should also integrate legal, moral, systemic and environmental constraints, as well as the future of the next generation. Design/methodology/approach: Negotiation techniques may serve any goal, and therefore lead to irresponsible processes and outcomes. A selected review of the literature on negotiation theory is explored, and its current concepts are complemented to integrate responsibility. Findings: In total, seven levels of responsibility can be identified for negotiation: towards oneself, the other, respective principals, implementers, absentees, legal compliance, moral norms and values, and the next generation. Research limitations/implications: It is not clear if responsibility for negotiators should be studied in terms of degrees on a continuum towards heightened responsibility, or if a negotiator should pass the seven‐step test to be considered responsible. Practical implications: Negotiation skills are essential for leaders, who negotiate every day. Too often, however, negotiators' measure of success does not integrate responsibility. Social implications: Negotiation involves social interactions, but is often conceived as a self‐centered process, and at best as a dual or two‐level game. It is essential to show how negotiations have social implications that go much beyond these close interpersonal interactions. Originality/value: There is no other structured article on “responsible negotiation” – which means the paper fills a gap in the management literature.

Specifically, within the engineering field, today's businesses now seek innovative engineer-managers who can design engineering systems and also handle projects/design and development; create strategic plans; handle financing; and recognize, engage with, and evaluate market opportunities. This has created a need for current research on effective engineering management education that focuses on technical people, projects, and organizations and prepares engineer and science graduates to become future industry leaders and be successful long term. Cases on Engineering Management Education in Practice explores the crucial role of innovative and effective education that helps graduates develop critical leadership, negotiation, and communication skills in specific engineering disciplines. It presents the latest scholarly information on curriculum development, instructional design, and pedagogies of engineering management learning initiatives focusing on a range of topics that fall under the scope of engineering management education practices including management, marketing, finance, law, leadership, organizational behaviors, and human resources and statistics. While highlighting topics such as curriculum reform, student motivation and engagement, and innovative learning and education practices, this book is ideal for teachers, administrators, instructional designers, researchers, practitioners, stakeholders, academicians, and students who are interested in the management of engineering education practices. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Extant research on gender in career negotiations emphasizes women's disadvantages relative to men in compensation negotiations. We present an inductive study of what and how women negotiate for career advancement and the attainment of leadership positions in organizations, drawing on data from diverse samples of negotiation accounts by senior executive, mid-level, and early career professionals from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors and six world regions. Integrating insights from six studies, we propose a more comprehensive perspective on what men and women negotiate for career advancement, including their role development and work-family conflicts, as well as compensation. We also identify three distinct negotiating strategies-asking, bending, and shaping-that vary in the extent to which the negotiator conforms to, deviates from, or attempts to redefine organizational norms. Our analyses suggest that the choice of negotiating strategy has implications for men's and women's career progression, particularly for women's navigation of nontraditional career paths and men's and women's leadership claiming.

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews with 10 out of 14 trainee doctors who were fellows between 2013-2016, exploring how leadership knowledge and skills were used in clinical practice, impact on patient care and influence on careers. Data, gathered in 2017 when participants had completed the fellowship between 1-3 years, were analysed thematically. Findings: All found the fellowship rewarding. The experience was felt to advantage them in consultant interviews. They gained insight into the wider influence on organisations and the complexity of issues facing senior clinicians. Although subtle, the impact was significant, equipping fellows with negotiation skills, enabling them to better influence change. Indirect impact on clinical practice was evidenced by enhanced confidence, teamworking skills and progression of improvement projects. However, the use of skills was limited by lack of seniority within teams, demands of medical training and examinations. The negativity of others towards management and leadership was also noted by some. Research limitations/implications: Small participant numbers limit generalisability. Practical implications: The fellowship is designed to equip participants with skills to lead improvements in healthcare delivery. Those more advanced in their medical training had greater opportunity and seniority to lead change and were better placed to apply the learning.

But more often, and often more effectively, leaders lead through their words, by acts of speech, as it were. They are frequently called upon to speak and write, formally and informally, to convey their vision for their organization to their staff and constituents. In doing so, they are not only announcing that vision, but are engaging in a rhetorical negotiation with their audience, trying out words, phrases, and literary constructions to better and more convincingly communicate their vision of their organization and the direction in which they wish to take it. If their rhetoric fails, or is not wholly successful, they strive to change or modify it. Through such verbal exchanges, leaders communicate the style and substance of their leadership and give form and imaginative life to their vision for the organization. Howard Gardner (1995), the Harvard psychologist, has written that ‘[L]eaders achieve their effectiveness chiefly through the stories they relate’. He calls these stories ‘stories of identity’, narratives ‘that help individuals think about and feel who they are, where they come from, and where they are headed’ and that such stories ‘constitute the single most powerful weapon in the leader’s literary arsenal’. This essay recounts, as a case study, the role of such stories in the turnaround of an organization, the Harvard University Art Museums, and reflects generally on the role of rhetoric in leadership. © 2005, Sage Publications.

Design/methodology/approach - The concept of contingent reward has largely remained unchanged since 1985. Consequently, the items of contingent reward were examined in terms of their content validity that was guided by transactional leadership theory, re-formulated path-goal theory of leadership, and negotiation theory. Three new contingent reward factors were identified (i.e. framing, clarifying, and rewarding). These were examined using one-factor congeneric measurement models. Valid factors were identified using a high-order confirmatory factor analysis to further confirm the structural validity of the three new factors of contingent reward. Finally, structural equation models were calculated to examine the relationships among contingent reward factors and extra effort. Findings - Three distinct factors of contingent reward were identified and their relationships with extra effort was consistent with the integrative negotiation strategies where each factor formed part of a negotiation process. Contingent reward (framing) initiates the negotiation process and directly loads on contingent reward (rewarding and clarifying); contingent reward (framing) did not directly load on to extra effort. Contingent reward (rewarding) supports the negotiation process by loading directly on contingent reward (clarifying). The negotiation process is completed with contingent reward (clarifying) directly loading on extra effort. These three contingent reward factors form a simple negotiation process that highlights several important aspect of the leader/follower reward performance relationship. Research limitations/implications - This study uses a cross-sectional design that means that its findings may not be generalisable to other populations. However, the findings of this study should encourage researchers to appreciate that common leadership behaviour, like contingent reward, may have more complex interrelationships with outcome factors such as extra effort than previously expected. Practical implications - Leaders should view their use of contingent reward behaviours in terms of a process rather than simply exhibiting a single clarifying contingent reward type behaviour. In other words, leaders need to establish the boundaries (i.e. framing), acknowledge involvement (i.e. rewarding), and then elucidate mutual outcomes (i.e. clarifying). This process should enable leaders to negotiate greater flexibilities and create more momentum within their leader/follower performance reward relationships. Originality/value - This paper challenges the foundation ideas and empirical pedigree of contingent reward and incorporates advances in theories such as the reformulated path-goal theory and interpret the behaviours in a broader multi-disciplinary context, i.e. integrative negotiation strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Motivation (psychology); Negotiating; Transactional leadership","Article","Scopus"

Although the leader and the follower cooperate in their component purchase, they compete in selling their end products. We first analyze the most common and simple form of LCB, equal price LCB, under which the follower pays to the leader the same wholesale price that the leader obtains from his negotiation with the supplier. We compare each buyer's profit under the equal price LCB with the benchmark where each buyer purchases separately from the supplier. We find that although the alliance might obtain a lower wholesale price and although the leader is always better off under equal price LCB, the follower can be worse off if the competition intensity of the leader's and follower's products is within an intermediate region. We identify a competition effect resulting from equal price LCB that can place the follower at a disadvantage in the competition. This finding implies that the equal price LCB might not be sustainable in practice. In view of this limitation, we investigate an alternative form of LCB, fixed price LCB, under which the follower pays a fixed price to the leader regardless of the wholesale price the leader obtains from the supplier. We show that fixed price LCB benefits not only the leader but also the follower, compared with separate purchases, which implies that fixed price LCB always achieves a win-win outcome for the buyers. Our analysis further shows that even the supplier might benefit from this form of LCB. © 2016 INFORMS.","Commitment; Equal price mechanism; Fixed price mechanism; Leader-based collective bargaining; Separate purchase","Article","Scopus"

Despite growing interest in collective leadership its definition, and understandings of the contextually situated process through which it develops, are limited. We draw on a five-year longitudinal study to explain how collective leadership develops through ongoing negotiations between strategic ambiguity and reification. We delineate between directed work, collective work, and collective leadership to bring conceptual and definitional clarity to the field. We develop a process model to explain how contextual conditions influence the development of collective leadership. Introducing the concepts of accommodated divergence, directed convergence, and unified divergence we show how interorganizational collaborations can move from collective work to collective leadership. We argue that ‘unified divergence’ enables us to provide a more precise conceptual definition of collective leadership, which we define as: the interaction of strategic ambiguity and inward- and outward-facing reification practices, resulting in agreed collective aims, alignment and coordination of activities, commitment to collective success, and the maintenance of divergent perspectives. © 2021 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","collective leadership; interorganizational collaboration; reification; strategic ambiguity","Article","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on the data of a larger qualitative study conducted using the life history approach. Cases of four male and female middle leaders, which are able to demonstrate the ""efficacy"" of life stories to enhancing our appreciation of the process of gender negotiation and the impact of gender dynamics on leadership behaviour, are reported. Findings: Evidence suggests that traditional Chinese gender identities played out in the leader-follower relationships although signs of hybrid gender identities were also evident in some cases. Gender identities and the family role perception of the middle leaders have impact on their career aspirations and development. Research limitations/implications: Findings yield implications for the professional development needs of Chinese middle leaders not only regarding their professional role but also their personal understanding of how gender identities and family role perception impact on their career development. Further study with overlapping and complementary methods to a larger sample could be more illuminating to this complex and multifaceted issue. Originality value: In the context of global concerns about the shortage of leader talent, the present study illuminates gender identities and the dynamics of the interactions between Chinese superiors and subordinates of different sexes and adds perspective to the leadership development literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Career aspiration; Career development; China; Chinese gender system; Gender; Gender identities; Hong Kong; Leadership; Middle leader","Article","Scopus"

In this study, we argue that distributive politics helps explain the “haircut”—or losses—private creditors take in debt restructuring cases. Despite the expected convergence of partisan policies in a globalized economy, we argue that right and left leaders extract different settlements in debt negotiations. Left governments, representing constituents most likely to be hurt from higher debt repayment, credibly demonstrate more bargaining power and extract greater concessions from creditors. Distributive politics, however, is an indeterminate factor in explaining states entrance into debt negotiations. We use recently released data on the outcome of sovereign debt restructuring cases between states and private creditors from 1975 to 2013 to test our expectations. Results from a double-hurdle model indicate that creditors receive a larger haircut when negotiating with left governments. © The Author(s) 2018.","bargaining; political economy; political leadership; sovereign credit","Article","Scopus"

This paper proposes that the Catholic Social Teaching concepts of subsidiarity and solidarity provide the guiding principles to integrate participation because together they can account for all stakeholders while advancing business goals. To operationalize these principles, this paper suggests that the dispute resolution field has developed analytical frameworks to assess and reimagine current policies, procedures, and culture for dispute resolution (Dispute Systems Design) and shared decision making (Shared Decision System Design).

After the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, Japan relied on the U.S.–Japan alliance to structure East Asia’s new international order; the alliance expected close cooperation with East Asian countries such as China to maintain the region’s stability. Japan economically and environmentally supported China to reduce any disagreements over international security policy. However, during negotiations, China frequently cited history and the Taiwanese issue in an attempt to contain expansion of the Japan–U.S. military cooperation, resulting in increased Japan–China confrontation over security issues. China did, however, actively agree with Japan’s cooperation proposal, regardless of its perpetual ill feelings toward Japan. Therefore, although Japan–China economic relations strengthened, their security relations remained conflicted. Such complex relations defined Japan–China relations after the cessation of the Cold War. © 2017, Tamkang University.

We argue that charisma and humility in CEOs alter two of the most important decisions of investment bankers: determining the firm's offer price range and setting the firm's actual offer price. Specifically, we argue that the perceptions and negotiation abilities of more charismatic CEOs result in higher offer prices and smaller offer price ranges for their firms. We also argue that the perceptions and negotiation abilities of more humble CEOs result in lower offer prices and broader offer price ranges for their firms. Managerial Summary: We investigate how charisma and humility in CEOs of firms undertaking an initial public offering influence two of the most important decisions of investment bankers: determining the firm's offer price range and setting the firm's actual offer price. We show that firms led by more charismatic CEOs enjoy higher offer prices and smaller offer price ranges due to their perceptions of being an effective leader and their strong negotiation abilities. We also show that firms led by more humble CEOs have lower offer prices and broader offer price ranges since humble leaders fall outside of expected perceptions of effective leaders and lack strong negotiation abilities.

The leader was seen as the expert who was capable of making effective decisions on most work matters since he dealt with a pattern of recurring work problems. At the same time, the educational level of most workers was low and their social values, shaped by the British class system with its emphasis on levels of authority, status and influence, were such that autocratic decisions were accepted without question, indeed expected. During the period 1945 to 1970, the growth of union power was the main force which caused leaders to adopt what could be called the consultative/negotiative style. The aim of consultation was to gain commitment to decisions made by management and resulted in the creation of the so-called works councils. The aim of negotiation, on the other hand, was to reach compromise decisions and resulted in the employment of an army of industrial relations experts, and an explosion in industrial relations procedures and government legislation.

Elections determine who will be in control of policy in the future, which affects how leaders bargain today. Elections also determine the deals policymakers will agree to. Finally, proposers have the opportunity to shape the contours of domestic political competition with what is offered in pre-electoral bargaining. We identify that several canonical results in the literature – like the Schelling conjecture or the idea that hawkish leaders have an innate bargaining advantage over dovish leaders – only hold under certain restrictions on how voters evaluate their leaders. In contrast, we show paradoxically that when voters are prospective, electoral incentives shade the ability for domestic leaders to negotiate better deals for their publics. Counterintuitively, this leads to hawks agreeing to more conciliatory agreements than doves. © The Author(s) 2022.","bargaining; domestic politics; international cooperation; negotiations","Article","Scopus"

My argument is that Trump’s coercive negotiation style is best understood through the prism of his four public roles: observer, performer, controller, and disrupter. In this article, I analyze how these roles translate into his negotiating behavior. Spotting and exploiting vulnerability is his trade; leverage and bravado are his tools. After assessing the opposing side, Trump uses leverage to threaten his counterparts’ weaknesses, while using bravado to play up the advantages of reaching an agreement on his terms. This way, he presents a drastic structured choice to his opponents, leaving them the least maneuvering space. In the final section of the paper, I illustrate how the four-role framework helps explain Trump’s decisions in the nuclear negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The study explores rebels' social network structure as a source of negotiation flexibility. The proposition that a rebel group structured as a ""trust network"" can manage the risks of peace making through a ""trust mechanism"" of information sharing, verification, and mutual influence between rebel negotiators and non-negotiating rebel leaders, is consistent with a procedural justice logic. The proposition is analyzed for negotiations between LTTE and the Sri Lankan government, and Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) and the Indonesian government. The findings support the proposition, and highlight the potential of social network analysis to further the understanding of conflict resolution.

The spatial allocation of land use constitutes a land-leasing policy operation of local officials, contributing to local economic development and fluctuation. Applying data from 283 prefectural units from 2003 to 2012, this paper explores the existence of land finance cycles, focussing on the changes of the amount (as in ‘area’) of land-leasing by negotiation or by auction. The empirical results suggest that land finance cycles synchronise with the PCCP (Provincial Congress of the Communist Party) cycles, in which a prefectural leader decreases the amount of land leased through negotiation and increases that of land leased through auction prior to the year of the PCCP. The findings of empirical results are consistent with the prediction of our theoretical model. Additionally, due to the existence of high uncertainty of prefectural leaders’ tenure and political turnover, the effect of prefectural leaders’ tenure on land finance cycles is more apparent in the early years of their tenure. The results indicate that Chinese leaders’ fiscal strategies are likely to be driven by career concerns for the purpose of maximising a measured economic performance and fiscal rents. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","fiscal incentives; land conveyance; land finance; land-leasing; prefectural governments","Article","Scopus"

We hypothesized that the Palestinian leaders, as nonstate actors, would engage in outbidding by showing a more aggressive, backward-looking orientation in public. Israeli leaders, as state actors, would engage in frontstage-backstage behavior and display a more balanced public rhetoric. The results showed that the Palestinians focused on justice issues framed as mistrust and backward looking. This public framing was associated with retreat in the private talks.

The development of information technologies has contributed to the evolution of a new direction in international negotiations, which can be called the online contractual process. It is much more significant than traditional agreements in terms of power, effectiveness and influence. The struggle for economic and political spheres of influence, capital and power is unfolding in the virtual information space and is acquiring new, post-traditional virtual forms. Country leaders can instantly transfer information into the sphere of action using virtual space to express their position. When working on the article, the authors used the methods of collecting and studying individual facts, generalization, scientific abstraction, pattern recognition, as well as the method of objectivity, concreteness and pluralism. It has been concluded that electronic messages of country leaders on social networks are of particular importance in international relations since they represent unilateral constitutional acts, which in some cases seriously change the political situation. The legal nature of legally significant electronic messages of country leaders is an independent legal category, which has a set of its own unique characteristics. Electronic messages expressing the will of a person vested with authority belong to legally significant messages, which can be placed between legal transactions and legal actions. This determines the existence of elements of both categories. However, the existence of independent characteristics peculiar only to this phenomenon allows concluding about the emergence of a new legal phenomenon – legally significant electronic messages of country leaders, the essence of which represents one of the types of lawful actions with a specific legal procedure. Conclusions, made in the research, allow qualifying the communication of politicians online as a full-fledged negotiation process, generating certain legal consequences and introducing a category of politicians’ public electronic messages into the legal field. © BEIESP.","Buyer; Deal; Electronic commerce; Electronic digital signature; Electronic documents; Legally significant messages; Seller","Article","Scopus"

Numerous frameworks have been created and utilized in the various treatises on negotiations; analyzing the power differential in any given situation is a common teaching technique. However, despite this focus on the topic, discussions of power have been mainly focused on negotiations in the private sector. As a result, many of the most common frameworks are oriented toward this type of situation, resulting in a clumsy application to a public-sector negotiation. Given the growing importance of negotiations to public-sector leaders, we provide a new structure for analyzing power that can be utilized in such situations. For a municipal leader confronted with a complex public-private partnership, it is important to have the right tools to use when examining the power dynamics at play. After examining several current models of power, as well as other writings on the topic in negotiation and strategy literature, we present a new model. This model divides power into different categories based on whether it stems from formal or informal mechanisms, and then offers several specific forms relevant to the public sector. We then use this new model to examine a case study involving the new mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire and her efforts to negotiate a better response to the opioid and homelessness crisis. This case study illustrates the unique nature of public sector negotiations and provides a roadmap for negotiators looking to use our new framework. © 2020 President and Fellows of Harvard College","local government; negotiation; public negotiations; public-private partnerships; sources of power; state government","Article","Scopus"

Yet, how to achieve it is in part an open question. While previous studies have considered how strategic coherence may emerge across top levels of management through strategic planning activities and negotiations among senior leaders, we know much less about the contribution of other actors and processes behind the scenes (in non-strategy roles). Drawing on an ethnographic study of a public hospital's planning and project management practices, this paper therefore focuses on the bundles of practices, people and tools through which strategic coherence can emerge across different levels and sectors in mundane activities. We build on the concept of “enabling leadership”, grounded in practice theories of leadership, as our analytical lens. The study reveals how strategic coherence is socially constructed by practices of ‘fueling’, ‘shaping’ and ‘entwining’ mutually compatible meanings, in interactions among diverse people and tools. We propose a grounded model of the construction of strategic coherence as the progressive socialization of meanings about organizational direction that is not just administered from the top, nor naturally emergent from the grass-roots, but that is a collective and inherently socio-material accomplishment of enabling leadership. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collective leadership; Enabling leadership; Ethnography; Leadership as practice; Pluralistic settings; Project management; Strategic coherence; Strategic planning","Article","Scopus"

We show that social media platforms and their metrics play an important role in such power shifts by granting equal access to communication whilst potentially tilting information asymmetries in favour of the follower. The study also shows how these relationships can affect and even pervert the leaders’ problematic search for a ‘true self’. From this observation we draw attention to wider challenges in the social media context, which poses important questions for the leadership field. © The Author(s) 2019.","Critical Leadership Studies; followership; identity; power; Social media","Article","Scopus"

As the full dimensions of the clergy sex-abuse scandal in Boston came to light during 2002, the public response of Cardinal Law and other church leaders to victims, and groups of clergy and laity was often adversarial. While some of the Cardinal's actions were consistent with his stated goal of protecting children, his behavior revealed the unstated goal of protecting the institution of the church, its leadership structure, and ultimately, his own position. By contrast, Bishop Wilton Gregory's November 2002 presidential address to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops employed a more complex model of negotiation: he articulated broad goals to attract the support of his various audiences and postponed discussion of the controversies that will attend efforts to reach those goals. Ultimately, the future of relations among church members, clergy, and church leaders will depend, on how successfully these groups can negotiate church membership.","","Review","Scopus"

To prepare next-generation negotiators for these multifaceted challenges, negotiation instructors must keep pace with the rapidly evolving complexity of today's world. In this article, we introduce systemic multiconstituency exercises (SMCEs), a new educational tool for capturing this emerging reality and helping to close the experiential learning gap between the simulated and the non-simulated environment. We discuss our pedagogical rationale for developing The Transition, a seventy-two-party SMCE inspired by the complex conflicts in Afghanistan and Central Asia and then describe our experiences conducting multiple iterations of this simulation at Harvard University. We argue that SMCEs, in which stakeholders are embedded in clusters of overlapping networks, differ from conventional multiparty exercises because of their immersive character, emergent properties, and dynamic architecture. This design allows for the creation of crucial negotiation complexity challenges within a simulated exercise context, most importantly what we call “cognitive maelstroms,” nested negotiation networks, and cascading decision effects. Because of these features, SMCEs are uniquely suited for training participants in the art of network thinking in complex negotiations. Properly designed and executed, systemic multiconstituency exercises are next-generation teaching, training, and research platforms that carefully integrate negotiation, leadership, and decision-making challenges. © 2018 President and Fellows of Harvard College","complexity; constituencies; multiparty negotiation; negotiation; negotiation simulations; negotiation teaching; networks; system effects","Article","Scopus"

A very successful cooperative was identified, looking at: number of members, economic results and marketing. A sample of 36 managers and key figures filled up a structured questionnaire elaborated on the basis of a national survey developed by the Federal Council of Management. The outcomes of the Mixed Cooperative of Farmers from the Southeast Region of Goiás, were compared of this broad survey on the skills of managers and leaders in major Brazilian companies. The most important competencies for cooperative leaders that were identified are: responsibility, decision-making, initiative, honesty, leadership, personal motivation, self-confidence, good personal relationship, capacity for working in group, and negotiation skills. They also mentioned capacity to take risk, communication skills, capacity for planning ahead, innovative spirit and emotional stability as relevant to get reasonable results in this area. Comparing these results with the outcome of the national survey, it was found that six competences are more important in cooperatives than in other places: personal relations, capacity to take risks, personal motivation, negotiation skills, honesty and decision making. The presence of these skills and competencies show the high level of managers' competence in this cooperative, because they are helping the organization to provide positive outcomes for members in the last years. Thus, to prepare leaders to reach this profile in movements like cooperativism and farmers' associations seems to be a significant contribution to improve farming systems and help people to reach better life standards in rural sector. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

The analysis elucidates the negotiations of work–home pressures shaped by patriarchal gender roles, culturally constituted organizational perceptions of women and their leadership potential, and gendered discourses of leadership as the key themes reflecting the experiences with and understandings of leadership among women in STEM. Particularly salient are the double binds that women experience, reflecting, for instance, Asian cultural norms about gendered performance that foreground women’s roles in face saving and discourses of leadership that call for aggressiveness. Moreover, women experience gendered stereotypes about their content-based competence in STEM areas, further impeding the opportunities available for them to lead in STEM careers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Asia; discourses; leadership; organizations; patriarchy; women in STEM","Article","Scopus"

Our article addresses this gap by examining how sharing leadership is negotiated in team interactions that are steeped in asymmetry deriving from the professional hierarchy. Adopting a leadership-in-interaction approach, we draw on fine-grained analysis of observed interactions on interprofessional teams from two health care organizations to compare the discursive strategies used by professionals in a superior hierarchical position to the ones used by those in inferior positions to share leadership. These strategies are organized into a matrix of interactional moves that resist or enact the professional hierarchy. Empirical vignettes are provided to demonstrate how sharing leadership and hierarchical leadership can be co-present and even intertwined in an interaction. We show that leadership is shared (or not) as a result of how the professional hierarchy gets negotiated in interactions. More specifically, we conclude that the sharing of leadership in this context tends to occur prior to decision making, especially around problem formulation, if the interactional climate allows. Furthermore, it requires concrete effort: Those in superior positions of influence mindfully relax the hierarchy whereas those in inferior positions create moments of sharing leadership through resistance and struggle. © The Author(s) 2020.","Asymmetry; interprofessional teams; leadership-in-interaction; professional hierarchy; sharing leadership","Article","Scopus"

Drawing upon the analytical framework of Kelly's (1998) mobilization theory, the authors investigated what motivated workers to form a union and what factors facilitated unionization. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative research method on a single case study basis. The authors collected 41 in-depth interviews with game developers, full-time union staff from the case company and union leaders in their affiliated union, as well as game journalists, labour attorneys, and human resource professionals in the video game industry. The authors had their original data supplemented and triangulated by archival data including union letters and other documents and media reports. They analysed the data using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). Findings: There are three key findings. First, in the game sector, a high barrier against unionization exists, arising from industry characteristics such as a project-based work system, high mobility, reputation-based hiring, meritocracy, and a continuous influx of game-loving young developers. Hence, although the time was ripe for worker activism, latent grievances failed to be converted into real collective mobilization, resulting in non-organized workplaces for the past decades. Second, the mandatory labour-management negotiations arising from a legal change acted as a key catalyst for unionization at Company N. The newly elected three employee representatives came to identify and develop their own collective interests through the direct experience of negotiations, which greatly augmented their negative emotions and improved their legal consciousness. These three representatives could identify numerous deep-rooted problems, attribute these problems to their employer, and realize that they are ordinary salaried workers different from their employer. Going through the three-month negotiation and post-negotiation period, a set of ordinary game developers transformed themselves into natural union leaders who started a union in the game industry, which was traditionally non-organized. Third, various layers of external factors, such as a sister union, the upper umbrella union, the changed socio-political atmosphere following the candlelight protests for presidential impeachment, and the improved union image facilitated the unionization at Company N. Practical implications: This study offers practical implications to governments, union activists, and employers in the game sector and more broadly in the tech industry, where labour-management conflicts are escalating across the globe. Originality/value: Our study of a rare unionization event in the difficult game sector offers a nuanced understanding of mobilization and its process. Theoretically, by introducing the dynamic process of natural leader emergence and spontaneous union formation in a young industry where neither pre-existing leadership nor extant union influence exists, this study suggests that the mobilization process is more complex and variegated than suggested by Kelly's study and subsequent studies. Therefore, this study can advance the current discussion of mobilization mechanisms in the field of industrial relations. Our study also contributes to current research by introducing collective mobilization in a new context, i.e. the young, dynamic game industry in a non-Western country, which is a context that has been under-studied thus far. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crunch mode; Game developers; Mobilization; Natural leadership; South Korea; Spontaneous unionization","Article","Scopus"

Using grounded-theory methodology (GTM) analysis, it explores how effective leadership is viewed, articulated, and practiced in a period of change in contemporary United States-based ad agencies. In-depth interviews with 16 leaders led to formulation of a grounded theory of agency leadership with three interdependent core concepts: managing change, finding identity, and leading effectively. Successful leadership at the agency is a process of negotiation, adaptation, and collaboration. Negotiating external change poses numerous internal challenges and adaptation: talent flight, internal turf wars, and cultural shifts in agency composition. Leaders must demonstrate capability through both being (qualities) and doing (actions) and lay equal emphasis on performance (product) and human capital (people). Leaders’ change management abilities, hard and soft skills, collaborative vision, and managerial pragmatism are key to agency success.

We explore why narcissists perform counterproductive work behavior and offer advice on what organizations can do to prevent narcissists' counterproductivity. Subsequently, we discuss narcissism's relationship with leadership effectiveness, and propose a Narcissistic Leaders and Dominance Complementarity Model, which examines the dynamic interaction of narcissistic leaders' characteristics with those of their followers to predict leadership effectiveness. Finally, we suggest four areas of management that may benefit from incorporating narcissism as a determinant of their respective organizational outcomes of interest: international management, social issues in management/corporate social responsibility, entrepreneurship, and negotiation.","","Conference paper","Scopus"

Several cases of skirmishes, escalating in 2016 during the Four-Day War, demonstrate the security threat the conflict represents. Simultaneously, ongoing unsuccessful peace talks and escalations and de-escalations of violence at the line of contact indicate the failure to transform the conflict in either a peaceful or a violent way. This paper seeks to identify conditions contributing to the stalemate of the conflict. The key actors contributing to the conflict’s “frozenness” are the political leadership of Armenia and Azerbaijan and third parties represented by the Minsk Group. The failure to achieve a peaceful transformation is given by political hostilities carried out through negative labelling, uncompromising statements and the self-victimisation of the belligerents. Such activities deepen the grievances within the Azerbaijani and Armenian populaces, which in response to such behaviour does not support any concessions in negotiations. At the same time, the Minsk Group does not provide any concrete model for a peaceful settlement nor does it apply pressure on the belligerents to grant concessions. A violent transformation of the conflict is not possible due to the presence of third parties in the region which deter the belligerents from full-scale war. These findings indicate that in order to avoid the future failure of negotiations and violent escalations at the line of contact, the political leaderships of Armenia and Azerbaijan need to withdraw from mutual hostilities, the negotiation agenda and framework need to be changed and the third parties involved have to actively participate in the peace process. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Article","Scopus"

Women tend to play supporting roles in their parties in Bosnia Herzogovina. The workshop pushed them to consider how they could take up their agency in order to get what they needed to succeed in the elections. Unaccustomed to taking up their agency in this way, the women resisted.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a policy research study, involving documentary analysis, focusing on one specific bill and data from interviews with teachers’ union leaders and officials who participated in discussions on the bill, and/or in crucial negotiations concerning teaching regulation. Findings: It was found that unions’ leaders preferred to leave the licensing process for teaching as an open-ended and constantly negotiable issue with their employer rather than assuming the role of gatekeeper, understanding that this gave them more space and power to maneuvre in future struggles. Consequently, only the Education Ministry determines who becomes a teacher. Research limitations/implications: These findings can inform educational policy makers and stakeholders, by giving them a glimpse into policy considerations. New knowledge is offered for the development of theory concerning teaching profession regulation and involvement of the teacher unions in these processes.

It draws on the philosophically rooted concept of Humanistic Management as a lens to examine the relationship between SDG 2, the human right to food and reasons for the persistence of hunger in the world. The status quo and current approaches are presented in detail as dysfunctional, with an emphasis on the role of the WTO regulations, intellectual property rights schemes and negotiation processes. It is suggested that in order to develop future leaders who tackle global issues like this persistence of hunger in more promising and more responsible ways, business schools need to look beyond responsible management education. In this vein, Humanistic Management is also discussed as a platform for the advocated paradigm shift. It is highlighted through which stages business schools could transform their educational approach and provision accordingly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","Article","Scopus"

The paper presents a longitudinal case study of a merger of two listed French companies. The data were collected from participant observation, interviews, and archival documentation over two years. The case involves retrospective (premerger negotiation period) and real-time (merger period) data. Our study reveals three managerial biases during the negotiation period: (1) Anchoring bias with availability bias: a disappointing past experience for the acquiring firm; (2) Temporal bias: temporal pressure on the CEO and stakeholders; (3) Hubris bias and brakes: schizophrenia/ambiguity from the leaders of the acquired company. We also identified two factors reinforcing these biases during the integration process: (1) Social pressure of a major project: Greater Paris; (2) Expert’s role: failure to take into account the contributions of the other company. The study provides insight into organizational change in a merger context. The study contributes to the merger literature by highlighting managerial biases and reinforcing mechanisms during negotiation and integration periods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cognitive biases; Integration process; Longitudinal case study; Managerial biases; Merger and acquisition","Article","Scopus"

What standards can be used to determine whether student performance is superior, adequate, or inferior? How can teaching effectiveness be evaluated to determine whether students are receiving the instruction necessary to achieve the course learning objectives?

Even though copresence has been shown to overcome some differences among team members, the coordination literature provides little guidance on the relationship between coordination and leadership in highly specialized health settings. The purpose of this paper is to determine how different specialties involved in critical medical situations perceive the role of a leader and its contribution to effective crisis management, to better define leadership and improve interdisciplinary leadership and education. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study was conducted featuring purposively sampled, semi-structured interviews with 27 physicians, from three different specialties involved in crisis resource management in pediatric centers across Canada: Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Otolaryngology and Anesthesia. A total of three researchers independently organized participant responses into categories. The categories were further refined into conceptual themes through iterative negotiation among the researchers. Findings: Relatively “structured” (predictable) cases were amenable to concrete distributed leadership – the performance by micro-teams of specialized tasks with relative independence from each other. In contrast, relatively “unstructured” (unpredictable) cases required higher-level coordinative leadership – the overall management of the context and allocations of priorities by a designated individual. Originality/value: Crisis medicine relies on designated leadership over highly differentiated personnel and unpredictable events. This challenges the notion of organic coordination and upholds the validity of a concept of leadership for crisis medicine that is not reducible to simple coordination. The intersection of predictability of cases with types of leadership can be incorporated into medical simulation training to develop non-technical skills crisis management and adaptive leaderships skills. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coordination; Crisis resource management; Emergency; Training","Article","Scopus"

Specifically, both involve the interaction of motivated agents with distinct interests, perceptions, and values (especially in high-stakes contexts). As a result, robust strategy, creativity, and nimble tactics are essential both on the battlefield and at the bargaining table.

Hudec was pessimistic about the relationship becoming more productive, but his expression of despair offered a glimmer of hope: 'There are those who believe that the GATT has become so committed to the current policy that the only way to change it would be to start a new organization'. A new organisation was started, the World Trade Organization, but has the WTO achieved what Hudec hoped a new organisation might? At the 1987-95 Uruguay Round, developing country leaders acted as Hudec had hoped. They used international rules and bindings as leverage to support their own internally-driven reforms; to overcome generations of accumulated protection, to lock in reforms against the backsliding that had undone previous reforms. Dealing with the Uruguay Round's 'unbalanced outcome' and the overlapping 'implementation problem' have shaped the Doha Round, but the negotiations have misconceived and mismanaged both issues. Rather than seeking to identify their real economics, the negotiations have gone back to the traditional idea of special and differential treatment. Perhaps the largest cost of this mismanagement is that in many developing countries the unilateral momentum for liberalisation has waned. To the extent that the Doha negotiations have drawn attention away from the domestic issues that were the basis of developing country liberalisation - and enhanced the status of negotiators relative to the leaders who fought at home for reform - they have contributed to that waning. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","Article","Scopus"

The case study was about the Brazilian organization Ânima Educação, which is the greatest among the five largest publicly traded education companies in Brazil. Secondary data collection and content analysis was carried out. Findings: As emotional response toward the problems caused by the pandemic, the company's leadership adopted an empathic behavior, allowing traces of its empathic culture to emerge. Empathy was expressed through the implementation of SR practices aimed at workers (policy of not firing in the first two months of the pandemic), at students (provision of technological apparatus, online classes, physical/psychological assistance and negotiation of late fees) and at the society (assistance to the elderly). Originality/value: It was concluded that empathy can be taken as the emotional motivator for companies to engage in SR practices, especially in extreme circumstances in society, as the economic and health challenges that the world is experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic nowadays. SR practices, in turn, can foster even more empathy in organizations, mobilizing leaders and their respective groups in the creation and implementation of new practices, thus demonstrating that the relationship between empathy and SR practices is a “two-way street”. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Empathy; Pandemic; Universities; University social responsibility","Article","Scopus"

But the success of its adoption in the construction industry (CI) is influenced by the availability of professionals with the required SCM skills. This study examined SCM skills with a view to identify the existence of any relationship and complex structure among them using a data reduction technique. A well-structured questionnaire was administered to 215 construction professionals and a relatively high response rate of 82% was attained. A principal component analysis of the data was carried out, and this reduced the identified 24 SCM skill variables to four skill areas namely; information and human resource management competencies; leadership and negotiation competencies; process management competencies, and political sensitivity and salesmanship competencies. These forms the basis for effective SCM training in the context of the Nigerian CI. The study recommended that professionals and students in the CI should undergo trainings in these areas and educators should update their curriculum to be in track with current and emerging practices of SCM.

In a nutshell, it imparts the domain knowledge of inorganic strategies, like joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), in order to keep their global presence and brand loyalty in the emerging markets. Lastly, Bharti Airtel - MTN cross-country M&A case helps students to get involve in international investment decisions in the perspective of international business environment. They also come to know various sensitive issues while finalizing the deal between two unknown parties, further how deal got complicated consequently caused the deal failure in the twonegotiations during two successive years. Domain knowledge: Business Policy and Strategy Elective of the case: Inorganic Opportunities Focus part: Cross-border Mergers & Acquisitions For whom: BBA; MBA (Full-time and Executive); MDP's Estimated time for discussion: 120 minutes Method of lecture: Brainstorming; Group/Team participation. Case Synopsis To meet the international business commitments and prepare students to craft combat strategies for achieving translational entity's objectives, the present case aims to illustrate the effect of global business environmental factors while negotiating cross country M&A deals. It has been assisted by India - South Africa, a cross-border telecom deal. Further, it discusses key issues which have led to delay' consequently broken the inorganic negotiations that lead to strategic competitive and geographical advantage. In particular, this case builds a platform for management scholars to improve communication tactics whilst engaging in international business relatio ships. Conversely, it would be addressing sensitive issues in chronological order that how long-term negotiations would lead to collapse the cross-border relations. Exclusively, broken M&A deals help to find key failure negotiations which could be assist for choosing inorganic opportunities in future. We now know that the ""World is flat"" and ""Knowledge is borderless"". As such, economic changes are bound to be rapid. Complexity and disparity are possible major factors worrying world leaders and global institutions. Indian economy, today a competitive, deregulated and open economic system, is one of the major destinations for foreign investors in the world. India encourages foreign affiliates to establish operations in the country through direct investment, joint ventures, M&A and outsourcing contracts. The objective of present case is to describe and track critical factors behind the failure of mega cross-border deal between Bharti Airtel (India) and MTN Group (South Africa) in the global telecom industry. The case covers failure of advisors role-play and how negotiations were extended and leads to calling-off deal in the second innings - 2009 after it was first attempt in 2008. It also covers the role of government and regulatory bodies of the respective countries. The alliance would have improved Bharti's competitive position as a leading telecom company in the emerging markets. Bharti and MTN needed an excessive inward focus for a feasible merger, when competitors were trying to snatch their business. The history of mega mergers and acquisitions attest that most combinations end up by destroying shareholders value. Mergers fail largely because of expected synergies seize longer time to deliver, price is too high, or there is no complete in-charge. Bharti and MTN could have US$20 billion in revenues and over 200 million customers, making them the third biggest telecom company in the world after China Mobile and Vodafone. They would have spanned two continentals & able to cut costs by integrating technology and reducing overheads. After twofold negotiation talks in the two consecutive years, the deal has been broken and windup with some precautionary signals while choosing cross-border M&A by Indian entrepreneurs and other community world.","","Article","Scopus"

Professors Jochen Reb and Paul W. B. Atkins have gathered together the leading scholars and practitioners into a collection that seeks to address these questions and to demonstrate the theoretical and practical richness of mindfulness. This collection is deeply based in scholarship, taking care to discuss the history of mindfulness research, methodological challenges and critical debates; yet, it also includes several chapters by mindfulness teachers and practitioners. Thus, scholars interested in mindfulness can read rich descriptions of mindfulness interventions, and practitioners can better understand the empirical and theoretical basis of mindfulness research. While mindfulness has traditionally centered on stress reduction, here the concept is applied to new areas of management scholarship, helping to further our understanding of negotiation, decision making, work-life balance, creativity and leadership, among others. It is a resource for those already conducting research on mindfulness as well as those considering moving into this exciting new area of organizational scholarship. This collection will also be useful to practitioners and educators who would like to know what others have done that has been effective and what has not worked so well. Overall we anticipate that this collection will help establish mindfulness in organizations as an important topic within management research and practice. © Cambridge University Press 2015.","","Editorial","Scopus"

Using time series data for Norway, we estimate that changing from a conservative to a social democratic central government significantly reduces manufacturing wages and makes wages more responsive to unemployment. This result is consistent with a wage bargaining model augmented by political preferences of the union leaders and suggests that the effect of bargaining coordination depends on the political colour of the government.

Taking the cases of Fordwerke and Opel, this article demon- strates, however, that this general claim does not always fit the historical pattern of US companies in post-war Germany. When the choice between plant and industry bargaining became a major issue at Opel (1948-58) and Fordwerke (1960-65), there was no significant pressure by Detroit management for decentralized negotiations. The real promoters of plant bargaining were the local works councils and union organizations, whose ideas, however, were controversial within the broader IG Metall union organization. The majority of the union's leadership feared that a decentralization of bargaining could weaken overall organizational strength and solidarity, or even lead to autoworkers splitting from the union. A transatlantic link was important, too - yet on the labour rather than on the management side: The American United Automobile Workers (UAW) trade union, concerned about growing Ford and GM investments in Western Europe, actively supported a shift towards plant bargaining in Germany through bilateral contacts and through a lobby for international collective bargaining coordination under the auspices of the International Metalworkers Federation (IMF). Such a prospect sounded as threatening to IG Metall leaders as to Ford and GM management, and their collusion accordingly ensured that industry bargaining prevailed. From the compa- nies' point of view the costs and constraints of membership in the German employer association were a drawback more than offset by the advantage of being shielded against a scenario of militant wage pressure by German car workers drawing on international support. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","","Article","Scopus"

Data analysis and observation are carried out simultaneously, where data are analyzed directly after it is obtained using descriptive analysis. Interactive data analysis is carried out at the initial step by collecting primary and secondary data.

Findings: The development of ASEAN has led to the idea of “ASEAN Way,” namely, the ASEAN security forum to eliminate the use of force in maintaining relations between member countries through the dissemination of agreed values. Multilateral negotiations refer to the establishment of a negotiation regime at the ASEAN level that emphasizes the interests of ASEAN member countries in determining agreements relating to transnational drug crimes.

In this study, we explore ten cases of green economy of different sectors and approaches from five European countries and identify factors that have had critical importance for the success or failure of the cases. Our paper reveals similarities across small and large scale cases and different approaches for implementing green economy. We identified critical factors related to economic viability, public funding, technological development, impact assessments, public policies and regulation, social capital, leadership and coordination as well as public acceptability and image. According to our results, transition to green economies requires negotiation between potential trade-offs among multiple goals, and interests of various stakeholders. The mutual benefits can be communicated through valid impact assessments and the integration of R&D into the practical implementation. Securing the continuity of funding and leadership is crucial in successful experiments and attention should be paid to fostering social capital among stakeholders. Instead of any single critical factor, the practical implementation of green economy is related to a multiplicity of factors and causalities depending on the context.

Market demand faced by the retailer is stochastic and dependent on product quality level and marketing effort level. We propose a combined contract composed of option and cost-sharing to investigate coordination and profit allocation issues of the supply chain. To model loss aversion of the manufacturer, we employ multiple mental accounts and apply the utility function to upside and downside potentials of manufacturer's production decision separately. We derive the optimal strategy for each member with a Stackelberg game in which the retailer acts as the leader. It is proved that both coordination of the supply chain and Pareto-improvement can be achieved synchronously by the combined contract. In the premise of coordination, the system-wide profit can be allocated arbitrarily only by option price. Through negotiation, the retailer and the manufacturer just need to confirm an appropriate option price to obtain that neither of them becomes worse off. We also find that the manufacturer's loss aversion is a significant element for contract design and profit allocation, and the manufacturer could benefit from its own loss aversion behavior under certain condition. © 2018, Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization.","Loss aversion; Marketing effort; Option contract; Product quality; Supply chain coordination; VMI","Article","Scopus"

Most significantly, in 1945, he persuaded Nuremberg’s prosecutors to add the word “genocide” to one of the indictments against Nazi leaders. Following the Nuremberg trials, he lobbied states to adopt a United Nations (U.N.) Convention on Genocide, which he successfully did by 1948.

The present chapter addresses this question within the context of negotiation. After reviewing this question, we offer some justice-enhancing strategies for negotiators-particularly for managers seeking to manage conflicts in their organizations. Finally, the chapter looks at how the growth of Internet-based social networking websites (SNWs) changes both the context of negotiations and how managers might use justice-enhancing strategies. As we will make clear, social networking activities by job applicants and employees present challenges to managers who seek to balance their use of relevant information for decision making with their efforts to use justice-enhancing strategies. While “fairness” may sometimes be considered from an objective per-spective (e.g., if the facts in a dispute heavily weigh in favor of one side, then perhaps the settlement should also favor that side), usually fairness is considered from the perspective of the disputant. That is because people often act on their beliefs, and justice-related beliefs can be powerful (Lind, 2001). Generally, employees perceive higher levels of fairness under the following conditions: (a) the quantity and quality of outcomes received, such as a salary offer, pay raise, or working conditions, are greater (termed distributive justice; cf. Deutsch, 1975); (b) the quality of procedures employed to determine their outcomes, such as criteria and methods used for performance appraisals, seem appropriate (termed procedural justice; cf. Folger, 1987; Thibaut & Walker, 1975); (c) the quality of information they have received, such as explanations for organizational outcomes or procedures, is satisfactory (termed informational justice; cf. Greenberg, 1990); and (d) the quality of interpersonal treatment they have received during the enactment of procedures or explanations is respectful and considerate (termed both interactional justice [cf. Bies & Moag, 1986; Bies & Shapiro, 1987] and interpersonal justice [cf. Greenberg, 1993; Colquitt, 2001]). When employees perceive greater fairness in any of these ways, they typically behave more “cooperatively.” By this, we mean that the employees who perceive more fairness tend to comply more and to be more loyal and committed. Evidence of greater compliance from employees who perceive more fairness includes these employees filing fewer wrongful termination claims when terminated (Lind, Greenberg, Scott, & Welchans, 2000) and receiving fewer reprimands for noncompliance with organizational policies (Robbins, Summers, & Miller, 2000). Similarly, customers who feel more fairly treated have been found to comply more frequently with store requests for demographic and shopping habit information (Albrecht, 2002). Evidence of greater loyalty from those who perceive more fairness includes greater repeat business from customers who feel fairly treated (Conlon & Murray, 1996). Evidence of greater commitment from employees who perceive more fairness includes their tendency to go beyond mere compliance to assist organizations’ goals-that is, to express organizational commitment (cf., Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002; Meyer, Srinivas, Lal, & Topolynytsky, 2007). Because organizations, managers, and even fellow employees benefit when they have more compliant, loyal, and committed employees and customers, it behooves organizational authorities, leaders, team leaders, and coworkers to understand how to enhance perceptions of fairness on the part of those who interact with them. This may explain why numerous studies have theorized and established a link between fairness and cooperation (e.g., Tyler, 1990; Tyler & Blader, 2003, 2005). Curiously, few of the last studies and justice studies in general involve the context of negotiation-that is, in contexts in which (a) the parties have distinct, preferred solutions that are often incompatible and typically identified in advance of discussion; (b) the parties are interdependent, unable to obtain mutually acceptable outcomes without the cooperation of the other; and (c) discussion and persuasion are used to better understand each side’s underlying interests and preferences or to influence the other party or parties to accept outcomes that they would not normally accept (Lewicki, Barry, & Saunders, 2010; Kipnis, Schmidt, & Wilkinson, 1980; Pruitt, 1981; Putnam & Roloff, 1992). As a result, a question that is unanswered by past justice research is: Do negotiators who perceive the other negotiator as treating them more (rather than less) fairly behave “more cooperatively”? For this question to be meaningful, we need to clarify what we mean by both “fairly” and “more cooperatively” in a negotiation context. Negotiators who perceive “more fairness” perceive the ther negotiators at the table treating them with interpersonal respect and sincerity (interactional justice), giving them adequate information such as factually supported explanations for requested concessions (informational justice); using unbiased, ethical criteria to guide requested concessions (procedural justice); and proposing outcomes, or concessions, that meet the proposal recipient’s needs and hence do not impose hardship (distributive justice). Negotiators who act “more cooperatively” (a) comply more readily with the other negotiator’s requested concessions; (b) ask questions about the other other parties’ needs to genuinely learn how potentially to meet those needs in addition to their own; (c) make proposals that they believe can meet the needs of all parties at the table (helped by what they have learned during the negotiation about others’ needs); or (d) decline requested concessions by others in interpersonally sensitive ways, such as by providing an explanation that helps focus the conversation on mutual needs and shared benefits associated with reaching a mutually satisfying agreement. All of the last behaviors, except for readily complying with concessionmaking requests, illustrate what has been called an “integrative” (mutual problem solving-oriented) approach to negotiating. The antithesis of this has been called a “distributive” approach and consists of a self-oriented approach often characterized by a contentious and dominating manner. In summary, many past organizational justice studies have occurred outside a clear negotiation context (e.g., research has focused on reactions to layoffs, drug testing, selection, or performance appraisal decisions; cf. Cropanzano, 1993; Greenberg & Colquitt, 2005). Further, many negotiation studies have focused on factors other than issues of fairness. For example, many studies have investigated how personality variables (e.g., locus of control; cf. Rubin & Brown, 1975) or situational factors (e.g., time pressure; e.g., Yukl, 1974) affect negotiation; other studies have focused on cognitive (cf. Neale & Bazerman, 1991) and affective (e.g., Van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004) aspects of negotiation. Typically, when fairness is considered, it is only as a dependent variable that is measured post facto (e.g., Conlon & Ross, 1997). Yet, we know that in organizations, people have ongoing relationships and multiple opportunities for negotiation over time. These relationships and negotiation episodes are made more complex by the advent of new technologies. Because of a lack of research linking the topics of fairness and negotiation, we do not know whether negotiators who perceive more fairness (in all the ways described at the start of our chapter) will subsequently behave more cooperatively-either integratively or compliantly. We do not know exactly how unfairness interacts with other factors (such as information gathered via social networks) to affect subsequent negotiator behavior. As a start toward answering these questions, we first review the relatively sparse literature linking perceptions of fairness to subsequent negotiation behaviors or outcomes and then identify strategies that negotiators may use to enhance others’ perception of them as fair, as suggested by the negotiation studies we review and by the organizational justice literature. After doing this, we identify and discuss eight justice-enhancing strategies that can help those in conflict and negotiation settings experience fairness. We then consider the impact that Internet-based social networking and information search sites have on how our justice enhancement strategies can influence cooperation in negotiations. With these challenges in mind, we conclude by identifying questions in need of future research by negotiation scholars. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC Routledge is an imprint of Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

Proposed strategies are distilled from relevant theory and systematically investigated in case analyses of peace negotiations in Sri Lanka, Indonesian Aceh, and Senegal. The empirical findings indicate that although a coercive military capacity underpinned claims to ethnic representation, coercion did not dominate during the prenegotiation phase. During negotiations, noncoercive persuasion, as well as collective and selective incentives, clearly dominated. Moreover, the most important measures were internal to the negotiating rebel group. The successful rebel negotiator appeared to ""mobilize in reverse"" by initially targeting the core of military leaders followed by competitor groups and constituents. The article systematically examines across cases what measures rebel negotiators have used to ""ripen"" their own community, how these measures have been sequenced, and against whom they have been directed. The findings have important implications for the concepts of ripeness and prenegotiation and their requirements. The study underscores in particular the relevance of rebels' nonviolent commitment signals, something that has been largely overlooked in the research on nonstate armed actors. The policy implications suggest the possible benefits of third-party assistance to efforts to promote communication, public outreach, and procedural transparency on the nonstate side in connection with peace talks. © 2011 President and Fellows of Harvard College.","Aceh; Ethnic conflict; Geracan Aceh Merdeka; Indonesia; Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de la Casamance; Negotiation; Negotiation strategy; Nonstate party; Prenegotiation; Rebels; Ripeness; Senegal; Sri Lanka; Tamil Tigers; Two-level game","Article","Scopus"

Why was it created, and more importantly, why do states agree to join this institution? The ICC represents a serious intrusion into a traditional arena of state sovereignty: the right to administer justice to one's one nationals. Yet more than one hundred states have joined. Social scientists are hardly of one mind about this institution, arguing that it is (alternately) dangerous or irrelevant to achieving its main purposes: justice, peace, and stability. By contrast, we theorize that the ICC is a mechanism to assist states in self-binding, and draw on credible commitments theory to understand who commits to the ICC, and the early consequences of such commitments. This approach explains a counterintuitive finding: the states that are both the least and the most vulnerable to the possibility of an ICC case affecting their citizens have committed most readily to the ICC, while potentially vulnerable states with credible alternative means to hold leaders accountable do not. Similarly, ratification of the ICC is associated with tentative steps toward violence reduction and peace in those countries precisely least likely to be able to commit credibly to foreswear atrocities. These findings support the potential usefulness of the ICC as a mechanism for some governments to commit to ratchet down violence and get on the road to peaceful negotiations.

An examination of exemplar pedagogy from this body of literature suggests ways to prepare students to lead and actively participate in innovative, collaborative social change initiatives. Findings: Interdisciplinary competencies include teamwork, communication, contextual understanding, negotiation, critical thinking, leadership, openness and adaptability. Interprofessional educational models are difficult to implement, however, ethical responsibility of educators to prepare students for complex realities trumps the challenges. Practical implications: Interprofessional educational experiences can enable students to engage in generative and transformational learning which can later facilitate in creation of innovative solutions for society's recalcitrant physical, social and environmental issues.

Since the late 1980s, there has been a move towards negotiation at the enterprise level. Legislative reforms have occurred at both federal and state levels which present opportunities for individual enterprises to negotiate agreements defining terms and conditions considered to be most appropriate for their circumstances. Therefore, the nature of the work to be undertaken in a particular education system or in a particular school can now be determined by the specific needs of the system or the school. The advent of 'enterprise bargaining', enabling staff to negotiate with management about the conditions of teachers' work at the school site, has significant reverberations for the role of principals, particularly in the independent sector. This paper describes how one principal successfully dealt with the process of enterprise bargaining. In so doing, it attempts to elaborate on new perspectives relating to the nature of the leadership of school principals within changing educational environments as a whole. The literature so far has recognized that educational leadership needs to change, but there is little empirically based scholarship identifying the roles that are demanded for adjusting to new environments. This paper goes some way towards denoting appropriate leadership qualities that serve to facilitate new decision-making processes within a school setting. This concern appears to be particularly germane in the midst of an international trend towards the devolution of educational systems and site based management of schools; an environment of change which is likely to engender new understandings of decision-making jurisdictions and conflict resolution.","","Article","Scopus"

Case overview/synopsis: The case describes the development path of the Promprylad.Renovation project from its concept to the critical moment at the end of 2018. Yuriy Fyliuk – the case protagonist, acts as the main ideologist and leader of the project, the essence of which is the establishment of an innovation centre on the area of the old Promprylad plant in Ivano-Frankivsk. Impact investing was selected as the main project development tool, as it allows for attracting investors who share the aspiration for positive change of the city and potential financial benefit. The project is implemented in several stages as follows: partner involvement (Insha Osvita, MitOst, Pact Ukraine and LvBS), vision finalisation and research (together with Stanford Research Institute, Zotov & Co, FORMA Architects, Moris Group, etc.), the launch of the pilot floor (attracting more than $683,000 from allocated grants and more than $590,000 of private investments). Open equity crowdfunding and the purchase of the entire plant, with its subsequent renovation, should be the next stage. As of 2017, agreements have been reached to pay fully for the purchase of the plant by the end of 2019. After a successful pilot and lengthy negotiations, it was agreed that $1,000,000 should be paid by the end of 2018 and $2,000,000 by the end of 2019 to complete the buyout. However, as of the end of 2018, martial law was proclaimed in Ukraine. Hence, considering the risks, a major US investor refuses to contribute. The main dilemma is either to find a suitable solution to complete the buyout of the plant or to stop the project. Complexity academic level: This case can be used in the master’s programmes of business schools (MBA, Executive MBA, Entrepreneurship, etc.), as well as in training programmes for public and state sector managers. The case study will be particularly useful for mixed groups with representatives from different sectors of the economy. This case study might be taught in the following disciplines: social entrepreneurship, social investing, leadership and crisis management.

A system-wide optimal policy should be well aligned with each participant's individual beneficial viewpoint. In this paper, we develop a fair and equitable mechanism of sharing the profits achieved due to cooperation in a supply chain between a single manufacturer and a single retailer. At first, we take into account the bargaining dynamics between them. We assume that the current supply chain is not coordinated such that the leader (the dominating partner) determines the lot size unilaterally. The follower (the weak partner) proposes to pay a compensatory payment according to the leader's modified lot size. Throughout this lot size-dependent compensation called a 'quantity-incentive mechanism', we investigate how the modified lot size and the corresponding compensatory payment can be determined so that the parties are willing to cooperate.

We use nascent theory on societal norms for the behavior of each gender to explain why advocacy context moderates backlash. We show that assertive, self-advocating women suffer a social backlash (for example, decreased likability) because their behavior is associated with high negative masculine and low positive feminine characterizations. Non-assertive, other-advocating women suffer a leadership backlash (for example, lower presumed competency) because their behavior is associated with high negative feminine and low positive masculine characterizations.

The focus of discussions of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has been about capping carbon emissions and mechanisms to trade permits to pollute the atmosphere with carbon. In the history of climate change policies the role of business has been inauspicious, given how large corporations mobilised throughout the 1990s to create uncertainty about the science of anthropogenic global warming.

We argue that national culture impacts managerial attitudes and philosophies about environmental protection and thus affects the willingness as well as the extent to which managers recognize the need for emissions control and disclosure. Based on a sample of 1,762 firms from 33 countries, we find that cultural dimensions of masculinity, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance are strongly and consistently related to carbon disclosure propensity, regardless of whether G. Hofstede, G. J. Hofstede, and Minkov (2010) or Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) culture measures are used. Our results also show individualism and long-term orientation has significant impact under the Hofstede measure, although not under GLOBE measures, after controlling for other compounding factors. In addition, our evidence implies that national culture may moderate the effect of carbon control mechanisms, such as emissions trading schemes. Finally, the empirical evidence indicates that the impact of culture is not sensitive to national wealth and industry membership. The findings suggest culture exerts incremental influences beyond economic and regulatory incentives and therefore should be adequately considered in the combat against global warming and particularly in negotiations for an international climate agreement that is more acceptable to societies with disparate cultural backgrounds. © 2016, American Accounting Association.

It shows that the hypothesis of rationality does not imply a one to one correspondence between illegal behavior and expected benefits and costs of the criminal action, since two different regimes may ensue from the threat of racketeering. These two regimes will be respectively characterized by acquiescence and no private protection activities, and by optimal private protection that will push OC into a zone of inaction. The latter outcome will correspond to a Stackelberg equilibrium of a preventive type in the sense that the action of the firm as a leader will confine OC in a zone of temporary inaction. Since the extent to which private protection will succeed in deterring the criminal is lower the higher is uncertainty, and the higher are public protection activities, switching from one regime to the other may thus be determined even by small changes in uncertainty or public protection. If public protection is below a critical level, the threat of extortion also creates incentives for the firm to enter an agreement with the criminal, by negotiating an acceptable rate of extortion. At the same time, however, higher public protection will favor a better deal for the victim in such a negotiation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Crime; Dynamic programming; Option value; Protection cost; Uncertainty","Article","Scopus"

Diverse specifications of these equations allow one to characterize the above mentioned hierarchical phenomena as well as to describe their interior structure. As an example, the equations can be used to differentiate between diverse kinds of hierarchical planning or between team and non-team situations within hierarchical bargaining. Since management can be considered as a planning and leadership activity to control the interrelationship of individual decision processes, the paper provides a better understanding of the general structure of the management process. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was one of the two heads of states who participated in the United Nations Conference on Human Environment (Stockholm Conference 1972). Since the days of Stockholm Conference, India has been an active participant at the multilateral environmental negotiations. India's engagement with IEL has been mutually beneficial. The leadership position that India assumed at the multilateral environmental negotiations has helped in including provisions in treaties that better reflected the realities of the developing countries. This in turn has helped IEL to gain wider participation and acceptability among the developing and under-developed countries. On the other hand, IEL has helped in the shaping and development of Indian environmental law. The influence of IEL on Indian law has been most visible in the following two ways: Helping the enactment of legislations in the field of environment and in the development of a robust environmental jurisprudence. This chapter focuses on the influence of IEL on Indian law and concludes that without the influence of the developments at the international level Indian environmental law would have remained much poorer. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

This chapter examines how disputants hostility interacts with gender to influence third-party mediator selection. Men are stereotypically seen as warriors  suggesting that people might want male mediators if they expect a tough fight. Women have long been perceived as more empathetic, making them more likely to be perceived as sympathetic to unfairness. An experimental study of over 390 subjects finds that when an adversary is more hostile, people strongly prefer male mediators. The stakes, however, and thus unfairness, do not play a role. Previous studies show that, compared to other forms of dispute management such as bilateral negotiations, third-party mediation is more likely to be employed in hostile disputes. Therefore, part of the preference for male mediators may derive from a gendered preference for mediators in hostile situations, a dynamic we call conditional sexism. © Jonathan Wilkenfeld, Kyle Beardsley and David Quinn 2019.

The leadership structure of courts discourages strong leadership but also requires negotiation and mediation to install new programs, so an effective chief judge can bring most of the governing body--the other judges--along when a decision is made to adopt TQM. As turnover on the bench is slow, the governing body remains throughout the period needed to institutionalize TQM. Courts already have a valuable and useful tool for thinking about “customers” and using data effectively in the Trial Court Performance Standards. Courts have been slow to adopt TQM to date, but there is growing interest and several leadership courts using TQM to improve various court functions. Courts' work mostly is processed in assembly-line fashion; using TQM's principles can help courts improve productivity, recognize and respond to customer needs more readily, and generally be better able to obtain taxpayer support. The courts are at once prime candidates for Total Quality Management (TQM) and a setting in which TQM is a hard sell. This article will explore why both elements of this statement are true. Acknowledging the difficulties, this article nonetheless concludes that TQM can and should be sold and that the courts will be better for the effort. Most Americans do not understand how courts work.(') Even less do they understand how courts are managed or why courts should involve any different management issues from other public agencies. To understand both the difficulties in having TQM accepted in courts and the fertile ground they offer, it may help to explore briefly the management context. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Article","Scopus"

Yet managerial support is often the biggest impediment to successfully adopting Agile, and limiting your Agile efforts to those of the development teams while doing the same old-style management will dramatically limit the ability of your organization to reach the next Agile level. Ángel Medinilla will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what Agile means to an organization and the manager's role in such an environment, i.e., how to manage, lead and motivate self-organizing teams and how to create an Agile corporate culture.

You will read how to change the paradigm of what management is about: it is not about arbitrary decisions, constant supervision and progress control, and the negotiation of changing requirements. It is about motivation, self-organization, responsibility, and the exploitation of all project stakeholders' knowledge.

That’s a missed opportunity. Questioning is a uniquely powerful tool for unlocking value in organizations: It spurs learning and the exchange of ideas, it fuels innovation and performance improvement, it builds rapport and trust among team members.

The model endogenously determines not only the timing of investments but also their capacities, the degree of overlap between the initial and the subsequent innovations, and the way the competitors resolve the dispute. It shows that the firms’ R&D competition in the burgeoning market is more likely to entail a lawsuit and distinctly differentiated products, while they easily agree on cross licensing to utilize each other’s works in the slow-growing market, leaving little difference between the products. From the perspective of public policy, it is clarified that the policy on patent scope cannot yield the first-best result in terms of the speed of innovation, and the welfare analysis shows that social welfare is higher when the conflict is settled via cross licensing. However, the weak protection on patent rights, which is shown to encourage cross licensing, does not always guarantee the highest level of social welfare since it weakens the leader’s bargaining power in the negotiation, leading to fewer advanced products with higher prices. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Cross licensing; Cumulative innovation; Litigation; Patent; R&D; Real options","Article","Scopus"

The negotiation is a show of tradition or customary norms where politeness strategies is observed during the discussions between the two disputing parties affected by the bride-kidnapping. During the discussions, rituals such as Sejati, Selabar, and Sorong Serah are conducted to neutralise anxiety, address face attacks and reduce disputes that may have arisen due to the bridekidnapping.

It is motivated by the growing shift to climate performance amongst the JSE listed companies in South Africa; hence the paper showcases the commitment of corporations in South Africa towards carbon disclosure. It thus shows exemplary commitment by corporations in an emerging economy to curb GHG emission through disclosure. The paper compared corporate South Africa carbon disclosure performance in 2012 with the 2011 disclosure performance. First, the performance of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) 100 carbon performance leaders were examined; and using a statistical t-test of difference in means, the paper finds that the 2012 carbon performance improved remarkably over the 2011 performance; hence the T-test indicates a significant difference in means between the 2012 and 2011 carbon performance. Secondly, the paper also examined the climate performance of the JSE 100 companies and also found a significant difference between the 2011 and 2012 performance which also depicts an improvement over the 2011 climate performance. It is perceptible that the 2011 UN Climate Conference in South Africa, coupled with the SA’s outstanding role in global climate change negotiations and the Carbon Disclosure Project is driving corporate SA to ‘walk the talk’ on climate change. In conclusion the paper highlights the need for further corporate climate initiatives, and calls on governments of developing countries to take a bold stance on climate negotiations as this is a key to encouraging the corporate toward climate friendly and carbon reduction initiatives. © Virtus Interpress.

While the European project was previously generally described as a teleological depoliticized project, aiming at building peace and comforting growth, different competing visions of the European project are nowadays acknowledged and surface among the public on occasions, like referendums or treaty negotiations. While EU official narratives are documented by studies on the European institutions or the visions of leaders and parties, their empirical analysis at the citizens' level is still fragmented. Using focus group data in four countries (France, Portugal, Italy and Belgium) and three social groups (21 group interviews), we provide a comparative qualitative answer to how citizens envision European integration. Our results show that, first, official narratives do not fail to reach citizens, but they are also loosened, contested, and do not systematically produce a sense of common belonging. Second, they highlight the importance of socio-economic contexts, as well as national and personal experience in the re-appropriation of these narratives. © 2022 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","attitudes; European integration; freedom of movement; narratives; peace","Article","Scopus"

This rapidly growing industry is a knowledge intensive industry that is constantly generating, and adapting to, new technology. The innovations are the movers leading to the growth of the biomedical industry since 1960. However, its growth may be threatened by the lack of access to capital, a burdensome and uncertain regulatory environment, and lack of R&D innovation and productivity. It is written for students and professionals in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine wanting to become a successful biomedical entrepreneur and to grow the biomedical industry. This book covers these four sectors of biomedical industries: Medical technologies, healthcare information technology, pharmaceutic industry and biotech. Many innovations are employed throughout the book to make this book as a resource of use to help you invent, evaluate, develop and market your innovative products. Part I examines the education merits of biomedical engineers and teaches biomedical professionals to conceptualize their innovations and to assess whether their innovations could be manufactured and be wanted by patients. Part II will guide budding entrepreneurs to form the company and entrepreneurial team, to raise venture capital, to patent your innovative products, to obtain regulatory approval and to write your business plan. Other important aspects of company operations like financing, negotiations, leadership, manufacturing, marketing and globalization are covered in Part III. Two concluding chapters, with excerpts from leaders in community, education and industries, touch on the development, growth and investment of biomedical entrepreneurs on the delivery of better healthcare and economy to all people in the world. © 2019 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the interdependence of learning, work and identity and a constructivist approach to identity as a point of departure. The design is qualitative with semi-structured interviews as the main source of data. Findings – For the learning potential in introductory programmes to be fulfilled, all parties involved must recognise a need for learning. This is especially important in organisations that are knowledge intensive and that demand highly skilled and competent workers, as negotiations of learner identity might be more demanding for this group of employees. Research limitations/implications – The current paper is situated in a specific organisational and national context, and only pays attention to some of the negotiations between expert and learner identities that are relevant if induction programmes and initiatives should be experienced as positive. Connections between identity work, learning and job performance for this group of workers should consequently be empirically investigated by a variety of methods and within several organisational and national contexts. Practical implications – The paper shows that it is vital for organisers and leaders to be sensitive to the significance that the identity work has for learning, when they plan, execute and evaluate induction programmes and initiatives for high-skilled and competent workers. Originality/value – The facilitation of job transitions and induction for high-skilled and experienced workers is underresearched, and the paper shows how identity and learning is closely connected for this group of employees. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","High-skilled workers; Identity; Introductory programs; Job-transition; Subject-position; Workplace learning","Article","Scopus"

Kissinger With stuttering growth in the Western economies where major sourcing and TMT (Technology, Media & Telecoms) contracts are pervasive, it is perhaps not surprising that internal and external legal counsel are increasingly being called upon to advise clients on termination options and strategies to effect or oppose a threatened termination for breach of contract. This short paper considers why this has happened and the other factors which are in play which have meant that advice on termination and the renegotiation of contracts in this context has become more common. Expertise in this area is part of an IT lawyer's tool kit and we consider that this is an area where internal and external legal counsel can make a substantial difference in delivering solutions to their clients. In this paper I talk about termination and renegotiation interchangeably. The reason for this as will become clear is that all forms of termination, whether they are consensual or contested, will involve some form of renegotiation of the terms of the contract between the parties. This is because it is almost impossible except perhaps in the simplest of installations to predict the nature in which a supplier or a customer may wish to change the services provided, and consequently even the most carefully crafted of exit and transition clauses, schedules and plans will require some form of post-contract negotiation between the customer, the outgoing supplier and potentially a new supplier or suppliers. This will necessarily involve some form of renegotiation of the terms of the contract between the parties. This paper looks at renegotiation in the context of a termination scenario rather than dealing with renegotiation during the normal course of operation of the contract. © 2011 M. Taylor.

It examines the course in three broad phases: passive resistance phase (March-October 1917), active armed resistance period (October 1917-April 1919) and period of trial and tribulation (April 1919 onward). It began with the refusal to send men for the labour corps and the successive failure of negotiations with government. The unprovoked burning of Mombi on 17 October 1917 by the Political Agent in Manipur led to active phase of armed resistance which went on till April 1919. This active phase was further subdivided into five phases, including the period of war preparation, first phase of confrontation, punishment to the ‘friendly’ villages, second phase of negotiation for truce, and then second phase of confrontation. The third phase of the war was the period of collective punishment to the Kukis. While their leaders were trialled and transported, the Kuki population were subjected to communal penal labour for five years.

Design-methodology-approach Mergers involve two different groups of executives – executives in place at the time of the acquisition (“incumbents”) and those brought into the target after the acquisition (“new-hires”). In order to understand why many target companies experience long-term instability in their top management teams, patterns of turnover in these two distinct groups were analyzed over a 17-year period in 730 target companies. Findings Analysis of the data revealed that a range of factors create conditions in target companies that lead to prolonged leadership instability. Different deal types such as tender offers, hostile takeovers, divestitures, and leveraged buyouts, the nature of merger negotiations, growth and profitability of the target company, headquarters location of the acquirer–whether foreign or domestic, and foreign investment experience of the acquirer all lead to significantly higher turnover rates for both incumbent and new-hire executives. These effects may continue for ten or more years after the acquisition. Practical implications Acquisitions create instability within target company top management teams. This instability can be traced back to conditions that existed at the time of the merger. Organizations involved in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) might leverage these new insights to more effectively deal with leadership issues early in the post-merger integration process. This may be an important first step in reestablishing long-term leadership continuity in acquired firms. Originality-value This research is the first to provide insight into the root causes of long-term leadership instability in target companies. It is also the first to examine the effects of M&As on executives who join a company several years after its acquisition. Future research by the author will report on the relationship between leadership stability and long-term performance in target companies. A deeper understanding of this relationship may provide new insights into why so many M&As fail. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","Article","Scopus"

A systematic review of trust research across levels and trust referents is sorely needed to synthesize the growing number of both micro and macro studies on this topic. Moreover, as trust is a linchpin for divergent areas, such as negotiation, leadership, team processes, human resource management, organizational change, entrepreneurship, and strategic alliances, a multilevel-multireferent review of trust can facilitate integration in the field of organizational sciences. In this review, the authors adopt a levels-of-analysis approach to organize the research on trust between 2000 and 2011 in multiple referents that include interpersonal, team, and organization at the individual, team, and organizational levels and analyze the similarities and differences in antecedents, consequences, and theoretical perspectives dominant at each level. Building on this foundation, the authors identify current strengths, weaknesses, and research gaps; offer recommendations for integration across levels and referents; and discuss lingering questions that research so far has overlooked. In doing so, the review offers a systematic and comprehensive view of the current state of the trust literature in organizational sciences and provides a blueprint for future research. © The Author(s) 2012.","levels of analysis; organizations; teams; trust; trust processes","Article","Scopus"

Through a focus on the union movement as a 'greedy institution', it is argued that women's union involvement requires complex and dynamic negotiations with its gendered discourses and practices. As a greedy institution, the union movement demands considerable depth of commitment and loyalty, as well as high levels of work and emotional labour. Based on a study of a network of women union officials, this paper discusses the ways women interpret three main aspects of trade union work: commitment, workload and emotional labour. I argue that the strategies the women officials employ do not remain static within a limited frame of gender difference from men. Rather, they must engage with the effects of male dominance of the union movement as well as the difficulties associated with union activism, family, service to members, leadership, and care in order to take up the political opportunities available in this greedy institution.","","Article","Scopus"

The cost and time consequences of stakeholders' negative actions could impinge on the economics of an organisation and thus industry. Stakeholder management is now recognised and entrenched in organisational developments. It is practised overtly or covertly in negotiations, dispute resolution, leadership functions, and so on. Strategies, tactics and tools for stakeholder management are increasingly deployed; including the use of information technology. While implementation of stakeholder management still faces challenges, some enablers are enhancing it. As stakeholder management continues to gain popularity, its phraseology will likely appear increasingly in contracts, procurement and other construction practices.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory study of six Muslim women social entrepreneurs was conducted using multiround, semistructured interviews in a contrast sample of three women who work with their husbands and three women who work without their husband’s involvement. Findings: The study identifies a variety of leadership behaviors that women entrepreneurs use to mitigate the constraining impact of strong patriarchal religious gender norms. Observations revealed surprisingly effective micro adjustments often based on relationship-specific private negotiations between the entrepreneurs and their husbands. Research limitations/implications: Future research focused on the husbands’ perspectives and behaviors, as well as extensions to other patriarchal religions and societies, are encouraged. Practical implications: Recognition of the crucial role of spousal relationships suggests the need for more holistic approaches to support women social entrepreneurship, e.g. by integrating husbands into related outreach programs. Social implications: Religious gender stereotypes such as the stronger altruistic orientation of women can help counteract, to a degree, Muslim patriarchal norms when women lead social enterprises. Leadership of social enterprises by women promises to promote more gender equality over time, even if associated private and relationship-specific accommodations are not intended to challenge religious gender norms. Originality/value: This study contributes to emerging research on the crucial role of spousal relationships for women’s entrepreneurship and the impact of private micro arrangements between spouses to mitigate the constraining impact of Muslim gender norms. Muslim women entrepreneurs approved of the religious gender norms that constrained them, in contrast to the more “feminist” perspectives common in women entrepreneurs in more secular and Christianity-dominated western societies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Indonesia; Muslim patriarchy; Servant leadership behaviors; Spousal relationships; Women’s social entrepreneurship","Article","Scopus"

Indonesia called for WTO negotiations with the European Union in December 2019, as the latter has imposed a higher tariff on palm oil. This study employed qualitative research in the form of newspaper content analysis carried out using NVivo 12. Firstly, the most frequent words used by The Jakarta Post and Harian Kompas were revealed through word frequency analysis. Then, sources, stereotyped images, and the cluster of facts or judgements used in the articles were examined. The goal was not only to see which dominant words appeared in both the newspapers, but also to discover whether positive or negative framing was more salient in the discussion of palm oil discrimination. Although The Jakarta Post appeared to use fewer negative words than Harian Kompas, further analysis revealed that both newspapers adopted the same negative tone in their framing. Negative framings were consistently found in their sources, stereotyped images, and clusters of judgements. This finding suggested a level of bias in the newspapers’ discussion of the European Union as the leader in fighting against climate change, and that the RED Initiative and Delegated Act as a way to attain the Paris Agreement, as these aspects of discussion were rather confined in their news coverage © 2021.

The traditional perspective on advocacy, promoted in mainstream public relations and marketing circles, is being replaced by a more interactive and integrated view on the role of advocacy communication. Newer theoretical and applied contributions to the health communication field support the need to explore (a) a broader understanding of the role of communication to promote and sustain health behavior; (b) a broader social scientific approach to public health as a social construct and the social determinants of health with stronger emphasis on health policies and management such as governance, accountability and leadership; and (c) policy perspectives that deal with resource allocation, human resources and capacity building, enabling environments for health communication, and recognition of the value and contribution of health communication to public health. Advocacy combines social networking and mobilization, interpersonal communication and negotiation, as well as the use of media for generating public pressure. The authors suggest that the power of supportive evidence as generated by professionals and academics must be effectively utilized through all these means in presenting a powerful case for sustainable social change. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Building on and furthering the postwar civil rights and anti-colonial struggles, the international anti-Apartheid movement brought together students, union workers, and religious leaders in an effort to draw attention to the horrors of Apartheid in South Africa. Whereas many left-leaning activists advocated sanctions and divestment, others, Sullivan among them, helped lead the way in drafting an alternative strategy for American business, one focused on corporate-sponsored black empowerment. Moving beyond both narrow criticisms of Sullivan as a sellout and corporate propaganda touting the benefits of the Sullivan Principles, this work draws on corporate and movement records to reveal the complex negotiations between white and black executives as they worked to situate themselves in relation to anti-racist movements in the Unites States and South Africa. In doing so, it furthermore reveals the links between modern corporate social responsibility and the fight for Black Power within the corporation. © The Author 2019.

This successful acquisition transformed Steria from a French company to European leader and doubled revenues from euro (€) 500 million to over €1 billion, while always maintaining profitability in spite of the collapse of the 'internet bubble'. We present first the view from the field: the effect on the personnel of the acquired and acquiring companies. Then we present the view from the headquarters of both companies: the motivations of the CEOs, the often contentious negotiations, and the successful integration. We develop the strategic implications of the acquisition for the new 'European' Steria and discuss possible alternatives for achieving the goal of doubling sales by 2006, as set by Steria's CEO. We conclude with 'lessons learned' that may be useful to companies considering major international acquisitions.

Previous academic literature ignores logistics operations costs in supply chain contracting. In this paper, we study contracting between a retailer in a developed country and a supplier in an emerging country while incorporating total landed cost (including logistics operations costs) in contracting. The retailer faces stochastic demand and stochastic lead time and determines the warehousing strategy. She can hold cycle stock and safety stock at the retail location (developed country warehousing) or allow the supplier to hold second-tier cycle stock at a warehouse in the emerging country in addition to her holding inventory at the retail location (emerging country warehousing). We study the retailer’s optimal warehousing strategy in a centralized supply chain and a decentralized supply chain with the retailer as the Stackelberg leader. When emerging country warehousing is adopted in the decentralized supply chain, the retailer and supplier could achieve a win–win or a win–lose outcome compared to developed country warehousing. Our results show that the retailer’s warehousing strategies in the centralized and decentralized supply chains could be different. We further study the retailer’s optimal warehousing strategy under the Nash bargaining framework where the wholesale price and logistics decisions are negotiated simultaneously given the warehousing strategy. We compare this contract to that where logistics costs are excluded from contract negotiation. Our results show that by including logistics costs into contract negotiation the retailer and supplier could achieve lose–win, win–win and win–lose outcomes. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society","contract negotiation; logistics operations; offshore procurement; warehousing strategy","Article","Scopus"

However, despite the wave of research into nongovernmental accountability, few empirical studies have grappled with the phenomenon’s inherently contested nature. This paper foregrounds tensions arising in the elaboration of nonprofit accountability. Its approach is informed by critical constructivist theory, an international relations approach attuned to social power, identity and exclusion, and conceptual contestation; its conclusions are supported by interview data with key stakeholders. Focusing on the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP) International, it finds that initial consensus on the desirability of beneficiary (downward) accountability quickly gave way to principled disagreements and operational difficulties. Specifically, the initiation stage of HAP was marked by two conflicts—a debate about enforcement and a turf war over control—culminating in rebranding and relocation. The implementation stage was characterized by tensions over certification and intra-organizational struggles over leadership. The contemporary practice of accountability is shown to be a contingent and contested social process, with humanitarian identity and practice ultimately at stake. © 2019, International Society for Third-Sector Research.","Accountability; Constructivism; Humanitarianism; International nongovernmental organizations (INGOs); Self-regulation","Article","Scopus"

Using a checklist of 60 empowerment indicators, the study developed a wheel of empowerment tool that graphically illustrates and compares levels of empowerment/disempowerment in local communities. Results indicate that although there is a will from many villagers to participate in tourism, lack of knowledge, limited economic resources and the poor negotiation skills of local leaders have disempowered the community from undertaking ecotourism ventures. Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have not supported the community until recently, the private sector has played little part, and while the Mexican government is shaping the course of indigenous ecotourism with support programmes, state agencies have resisted local ecotourism development. Overall, the community fell below the midpoint on the Wheel of Empowerment Scale.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper has qualitatively-driven, mixed method design including observational data, individual interviews, and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed according to Charmaz' view on constructivist grounded theory. Findings: A first step in boundary setting was to recognize areas with conflicting expectations and inexhaustible needs. Second, strategies were formed through negotiating the handling of managerial time commitment, resulting in boundary-setting, but also boundary-dissolving, approaches. The continuous process of individual recognition and negotiation could work as a form of proactive coping, provided that it was acknowledged and questioned. Research limitations/implications: These findings suggest that recognition of perceived boundary challenges can affect stress and coping. It would therefore be interesting to more accurately assess stress, coping, and health status among managers by means of other methodologies (e.g. physiological assessments). Practical implications: In regulating managers' work assignments, work-related stress and recovery, it seems important to: acknowledge boundary work as an ever-present dilemma requiring continuous negotiation; and encourage individuals and organizations to recognize conflicting perspectives inherent in the leadership assignment, in order to decrease harmful negotiations between them. Such awareness would benefit more sustainable management of healthcare practice.

An outsourcing order is equivalent to building an endogenous capacity and it generates a Stackelberg leadership effect for firm A which is absent in technology transfer. We show that compared to the situation of no contracts there are always Pareto improving outsourcing contracts (making both firms better off and all consumers at least weakly better off), but no Pareto improving technology transfer contracts.

Brexit negotiations were poorly planned, and the UK government was woefully unprepared. Brexit also threatened a serious re-opening of old wounds in Northern Ireland, as debate grows around the prospect of a united Ireland inside the EU. UK politics is in turmoil and in a chronic crisis. What route the Brexit saga takes next is uncertain. But the crossroads is approaching - either the UK leaves by 31 January 2020 with no deal or passes the deal the Boris Johnson has negotiated with the EU27. The Brexit process has revealed the weakness of Westminster's insular politics seemingly incapable of running a modern economy and society. Westminster's politics are becoming more not less dysfunctional. The phenomenon of British exceptionalism towards the EU is set to take a new dramatic turn, while the UK's chaotic political divisions will not disappear any time in the foreseeable future.

As the third largest exporter in the world, Germany is dependent on open markets; throughout the post-war period, government support for free trade has been unequivocal. Despite these positive incentives for expanding free trade, both German business and the wider public voiced fierce opposition to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). TTIP became a flash point for the German public to overcome collective action problems and create a broad protest movement against a free trade agreement for the first time in German history. This movement enabled the public to successfully exercise influence on German foreign economic policy-making, which had long been protected from public pressure. By 2015, the success of that pressure in penetrating the policy-making apparatus combined with growing government concern about the potential of international firms to undermine national policy.

Some of the implications of the differences found for multicultural management, for career development and for training programmes are then explored.

It is posited that a third approach is needed, that of 'idiosyncratic deals' (or 'i-deals'), which sees job design as a collaborative negotiation that has the potential to meet the needs of both organisation and employee.

It is generally assumed in the literature that customers simply want to get rid of their used products without expecting any compensation for them. Some authors have only recently started looking into firms that offer a posted (fixed) price for them. Following recent reports suggesting that customers are increasingly open to bargaining, we compare using a posted price and bargaining to obtain used products. In our analysis, we consider an original manufacturer acting as a monopolist as well as a manufacturer and an independent remanufacturer acting in a duopoly. We analytically show that bargaining is always beneficial to the monopoly manufacturer. In the duopoly case, we distinguish a Cournot competition and a market with the manufacturer as Stackelberg leader. The results of a numerical study show that both firms will use posted pricing in the Cournot competition, especially if bargaining is not costless. By contrast, the remanufacturer can significantly increase his profit by using negotiations if he is the Stackelberg follower. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bargaining; Closed-loop supply chains; Remanufacturing","Article","Scopus"

They do not just influence people's own actions; when expressed, emotions may also exert influence on other organization members who perceive the expressions. Sometimes emotional expressions have 'symmetrical' effects, in that positive expressions yield advantageous outcomes for the expresser, while negative expressions produce disadvantageous outcomes. In other cases effects are 'asymmetrical', such that negative emotional expressions generate beneficial outcomes for the expresser, while positive expressions produce detrimental outcomes. Drawing on Emotions as Social Information (EASI) theory, I develop a theoretical analysis of when and how expressions of anger and happiness generate symmetrical versus asymmetrical effects. I support my analysis with a review of empirical research on the interpersonal effects of anger and happiness in negotiations and leadership. This review permits two general conclusions: (1) symmetrical effects of anger and happiness are mediated by affective reactions of perceivers, whereas asymmetrical effects are mediated by inferential processes in perceivers; (2) the relative strength of affective reactions versus inferential processes (and thereby the likelihood of symmetrical versus asymmetrical effects) depends on the perceiver's information processing motivation and ability and on the perceived appropriateness of the emotional display.

It has thus become imperative that Portuguese managers explore new markets to promote their products and services in other countries. These facts have contributed to the raise of a new manager profile. The focus of this research will be on three types of managers: top managers, middle managers, and first line managers. In addition to their daily routines, these global managers have to face adversity and several cultural challenges while undertaking an international negotiation. They are faced with the need to develop critical cultural skills to be able to negotiate. This paper addresses the challenges of the theoretical articulation between management, leadership skills and communication, essential tools for the success of an international negotiation process. This article will establish that intercultural management skills are fundamental for this new type of global manager, which has to interact with many different cultures. Such skills highly benefit the new global manager's professional and organizational performance and are key for the success of their business relations.

Employing an interdisciplinary approach and drawing on a wide range of primary sources, including new archival evidence and oral histories, Yilmaz’s work delineates several specific examples of how individuals become Turkish citizens. She examines how Republican reforms were implemented and how they effected social and cultural change. By focusing on four specific areas of the state’s attempt to produce a new “Turk” and a modern Turkish nation (men’s clothing, women’s dress, language, and celebrations), she shows how individuals and communities received, reacted to, negotiated, and experienced reforms in their everyday lives.

Design/methodology/approach The approach takes the form of indepth interviews with communication executives. Findings Communication executives have a distinct strategic managerial role within their organizations. The executive role involves three different performances: the organizational leader; the communication leader; and the communication manager. Executives perceived high external legitimacy, whereas internal legitimacy varied between organizations, and status and formal position were both dynamic and subject to negotiation. The communication technology development, termed as a “revolution”, has considerably affected executives' work. Future communication challenges such as globalization and organizational change were discussed. Research limitations/implications Recent changes have strengthened the roles of the communication executives. Internal status and legitimacy appear to be dependent on the attitudes of the other executives. These relationships and the emerging executive roles will be an important basis for study in future research. Practical implications Internal legitimacy was clearly an issue of negotiation, which is important for practitioners to consider. Acting out the educational role, working with communication support and the coaching of managers, and initiating and pursuing strategic organizational issues may be means by which communication executives are further able to enhance their internal legitimacy. Originality/value New insights with regard to the legitimacy, practice and selfperceptions of communication executives are provided.

Perspective-taking is a psychological process that is particularly relevant to each of these activities. The current review critically examines perspective-taking research conducted by both management scholars and social psychologists and specifies perspective-taking's antecedents, consequences, mechanisms, and moderators, as well as identifies theoretical and/or empirical shortfalls. Our summary of the current state of perspective-taking research offers three important contributions. First, we offer a new definition of perspective-taking: the active cognitive process of imagining the world from another's vantage point or imagining oneself in another's shoes to understand their visual viewpoint, thoughts, motivations, intentions, and/or emotions. Second, we highlight that although perspective-taking has many positive benefits for managers and leaders, it also carries with it the potential for perverse effects. Third, we argue that previous theoretical lenses to understand perspective-taking's goal are insufficient in light of all the available evidence. Instead, we offer a new theoretical proposition to capture the full range of perspective-taking's positive and negative effects: perspective-taking helps individuals effectively navigate a world filled with mixed-motive social interactions. Our mixed-motive model of perspective-taking not only captures the current findings but also offers new directions for future research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ethics; Groups; Interpersonal and intergroup relations; Mixed-motive-interactions; Negotiations; Perspective-taking","Article","Scopus"

Some dispute has emerged over the extent to which policy-making at the international level has triggered and shaped these reforms. These disputes raise important theoretical questions about how we theorize and test for the degree of interdependence between international, European Union (EU), and domestic policy change. The concept of autonomous, linked games is offered as a possible theoretical route to follow, a route that also permits more systematic consideration of two possible roles of international organizations in policy-making: international mediators and entrepreneurial leaders. Drawing on these concepts, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is shown to be significantly shaped by proposals and outcomes in the international negotiations on agriculture during the GATT Uruguay Round, with the European Commission (EC) playing an entrepreneurial leader role.","","Article","Scopus"

This article argues that the Executive Agency initiative is primarily concerned with decentralization rather than markets. However, the majority of Agency leaders or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) are ill-placed to argue strongly the case for decentralization, they have a life-long civil service career to protect and a lifetime of hierarchical relationships with more senior managers from whom they are now expected to wrest control. The observations and experiences of six CEOs recruited from outside the public sector are used to demonstrate the competencies necessary for many Agencies.

The actors, rules and ideology components of 60 industrial relations systems, of which 15 exhibited a low propensity to strike and 45 a high propensity to strike, are compared via a discriminant analysis procedure. Strike‐vulnerable establishments as compared with harmonious units tend to include more strikers and have a more complicated structure of labour representation. In highly strike‐prone organizations, negotiations are usually handled by representatives equipped with limited authority. These organizations tend to be less prepared rulewise for a strike situation, and their ideology is less critical of promoting union leaders to managerial positions and less favourable of opening recruitment to out‐of‐plant competition. The comparison of the technological, economic and power constraints of the two strike propensity groups indicates that the conflictual units, as compared with organizations with a low strike propensity, tend to be larger units and service organizations; they are mostly budget controlled and publically owned. A comprehensive industrial relations system analysis indicates that the internal components of the industrial relations system take priority in discriminating between the two strike groups.

A 2 × 2 factorial design varied mediator behavioral style (task-oriented versus person-oriented) and deadline certainty (certain versus uncertain) in a simulated laboratory dispute. Disputants with task-oriented mediators made larger initial offers and reached settlement more rapidly under uncertain-deadline rather than certain-deadline conditions. Subjects with person-oriented mediators did not differ significantly in the size of their initial offers or speed of settlement across deadline condition. Similar interactions emerged for a number of attitudinal measures.

An analysis of the making of the award that became the subject of the strike challenges the widespread perception that the new award was definitively a consent matter. Consent and arbitrated components, together with important issues deferred for post-award negotiation, were each the subject of conflict. Mutually reinforcing choices made by the union, the employer and the tribunal produced an award that was unacceptable in the field. Choices contributing to post-award conflict were: the preference accorded advocacy over negotiation; absence of consultation with con stituencies ; pre-eminence accorded tribunal policy (the Principles) and the tribunal's non-interventionist posture. The Principles proved highly elastic and facilitated the masking of serious weaknesses in the award.

In cooperative advertising, a retailer implements local advertising and a manufacturer pays a part of the costs. In the literature of cooperative (co-op) advertising, the manufacturers often act as leaders and are followed by retailers (the manufacturers have the greater power than the retailers). According to the recent studies in marketing, retailers have increased their power equal or even greater than the manufacturers in many industries over the last two decades. When both parties in the supply chain have negotiation power, they may finally agree to cooperate rather than not to cooperate with each other. Therefore, we consider coordination of cooperative advertising between one manufacturer and two retailers when their relationships are symmetric and they cooperate to increase their profits. We use the concepts of group equilibria and cooperative games to find fair allocation schemes for dividing the total profit of grand coalition among the three members. © 2011 The authors 2011.

Drawing on interviews with those who served in Rabin's administration and with the settlers' leaders, this article contends that the prime minister's use of adversarial public rhetoric against the settlers denied the legitimacy of an influential stakeholder group, triggering a backlash of intense militancy from the right-wing minority. This, coupled with Rabin's failure to deal with opposing coalitions, diminished his capacity to implement ""landfar peace"" initiatives. The case illustrates a leader's failure to maintain adequate farms of engagement with key stakeholders. The accompanying analysis demonstrates that stakeholder theories, though incomplete in their existing forms, can still illuminate the high risk and ineffectiveness of denying the legitimacy of stakeholder groups and the strategic importance of maintaining channels of flexible negotiation and cooperation with seemingly marginal groups when high-stakes rivalries are likely to ensue.","","Article","Scopus"

Many unions faced a hostile environment for bargaining, with protracted negotiations in key sectors, attended by robust industrial action at times. The decline in union members and collective agreements reached a crisis point. A surprisingly diverse collection of individuals expressed concerns that the system of enterprise bargaining was not producing outcomes that were fair or economically sustainable, with some questioning whether the system had created the level playing field its architects had envisioned, as well expressing growing unease that reforms intended to constrain unions were undermining the original objective of the legislation. Heading into 2018, unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions were seeking a political and legislative solution to the seemingly entrenched industrial difficulties they face, campaigning around the theme ‘change the rules’. Without significant change in the system, it is difficult to see that the coming years will see any change to these dominant patterns. © 2018, © Australian Labour and Employment Relations Association (ALERA), SAGE Publications Ltd, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.","Collective bargaining; enterprise agreements; Fair Work Act; frames; industrial disputes; union membership; unions; wages","Article","Scopus"

Organizations are forced to be kinetic, organic, and without boundaries if they are to remain successful. Given these environmental and marketplace demands, scholars must rethink the applicability of existing organizational theories and frameworks.; In March 2001, a conference was held with the aim of developing and articulating this new model of organizations. Scholars contributed their expertise in areas, such as leadership, human resource management, negotiation and conflict, teams, entrepreneurship, organizational change, power and influence, and diversity. The contributors focused on their own area of expertise and considered how existing theories must be altered to fit a more agile, organizational form. Theoretical and empirical questions were raised, testable hypotheses were developed, and emerging themes were uncovered.; The end result of the conference is this volume. it brings together the reflections of a diverse collection of organizational theorists and researchers on the implications of this new business model within their own areas of expertise. The book’s goal is to inspire organizational scholars to develop a new theory and produce sound managerial advice for how to build and maintain a successful organization in a dynamic workplace. The chapters include a review of research literature with the highlights and citations that everybody working in a field must know, followed by how the research agenda is affected by the increasingly dynamic marketplace. © 2003 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

This chapter focuses on climate change and the capacities needed to address it. A holistic approach to sustainability is often referred to as the ""3E's"" of Environment, Economy, and Equity. Given the complex nature of the challenges facing our planet and its governance systems, I argue that we have reached a critical point where it is necessary to add a fourth ""E"" to the sustainability framework. I would call this fourth ""E"" Empathy, which in very real terms encompasses a broad range of practices such a transformative conflict resolution, valuing diversity, cross-cultural dialogue, reconciliation, consensus building, collaboration, interdependency, negotiation, mediation, civic engagement, democratic governance, and social justice. © 2015 by IGI Global.

The goal of effective team leaders should be to send signals and messages that increase trust. We attempt to determine if signals can vary perceptions of trustworthiness and if nonverbal behaviors, such as the voice, contain indicators of trust. In order to investigate the relationship between trust and vocal dynamics, this article presents a study that explores how the voice, measured unobtrusively, reflects a person's current level of perceived trust. We used an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to maximize consistency and control in questioning, timing, and interviewer nonverbal behavior, thus eliminating potential confounds that may be introduced due to interaction adaptation. Participants (N = 88) completed a face-to-face interview with the ECA and reported their perceptions of the ECA's trustworthiness. The results of the study revealed that vocal pitch was inversely related to perceived trust, but temporally variant; vocal pitch early in the interview reflected trust. The ECA was perceived as more trustworthy when smiling. While the results of this research suggest a relationship between vocal pitch and perceived levels of trust, more work needs to be done to clarify the causal relationship. Similarly, additional study needs to be done in order to integrate additional behavioral measurements that account for variation across diverse situations, people, and cultures. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Embodied conversational agent; Trust; Vocalics","Article","Scopus"

Flush from their successful conclusion of extensive multilateral trade reforms in the Uruguay Round, it seemed logical that the two leaders of the world trading system could work together to resolve their remaining trade problems and in the process set powerful precedents for the rest of the world to follow. In so doing, they would accelerate progress toward the ultimate goal of 'global free trade'. This paper examines Europe's trade and investment ties with Latin America and the Caribbean and prospects for the evolution of a TAFTA-South accord. We first summarise the progress to date in the various bilateral and regional trade initiatives. We then analyse bilateral trade and investment flows to determine each side's interests and objectives in pursuing free trade talks.

Attention to date has focused primarily on micro issues such as minimizing medication errors and adverse drug reactions, improving select aspects of care, and reducing diagnostic and treatment errors. However, attention is also required to a macro issue-an organization's culture and the level of leadership required to create a culture. This article discusses the concepts of culture and leadership and summarizes two paradigms that are useful in understanding the precursors of medical errors and developing interventions to prevent them: normal accident theory and high-reliability organization theory. It also delineates approaches to instilling a safety culture. Normal accident theory asserts that errors result from system failures. An important element of this perspective is the need for a system that collects, analyzes, and disseminates information from incidents and near misses as well as regular proactive checks on the system's vital signs. Four subcultures are necessary to support such an environment: a reporting culture, a just culture, a flexible culture, and a learning culture. High-reliability organization theory posits that accidents occur because individuals who operate and manage complex systems are themselves not sufficiently complex to sense and anticipate the problems generated by the system. Lessons learned from high-reliability organizations indicate that a safety culture is supported by migrated distributed decision making, management by exception or negotiation, and fostering a sense of the ""big picture."" Lessons from other industries are also shared in this article.","","Review","Scopus"

The paper identifies six fallacies and offers evidence and analysis to debunk them: (1) Agricultural border protection and subsidies are largely a developed-country phenomenon. (2) Developed-country agricultural subsidies and protection hurt the poorest developing countries most. (3) Developed-country subsidies and protection hurt the poor, rural households in the poorest countries.

This study examines how power struggles among CoPs can begin to structure knowledge creation processes. Drawing on a qualitative case study of a new medical research project, the study shows how power and knowledge negotiations became manifested through conflicting discursive positioning and coercive power affecting knowledge co-creation efforts. One CoP adopted an authoritative leader role, prioritized their own problem definition and knowledge creation process, and engaged in the peripheralization of other CoPs. The power and discursive moves prevented the development of shared problems and interconnected practices contributing to epistemological suspicion among the participating CoPs. The study offers new insights to research on power dynamics in situated learning and knowing by problematizing the relationship between localized practices and emerging interconnected practices, by shedding light on how discursive positioning and coercive power operate together, and by developing peripheralization and epistemological suspicion as potential explanations for how and why knowledge workers struggle to act on opportunities for knowledge co-creation. © The Author(s) 2021.","Collectivities of practice; communities of practice; conflict; knowledge co-creation; power; practice","Article","Scopus"

Market demand faced by the retailer is stochastic and dependent on product quality level and marketing effort level. We propose a combined contract composed of option and cost-sharing to investigate coordination and profit allocation issues of the supply chain. To model loss aversion of the manufacturer, we employ multiple mental accounts and apply the utility function to upside and downside potentials of manufacturer's production decision separately. We derive the optimal strategy for each member with a Stackelberg game in which the retailer acts as the leader. It is proved that both coordination of the supply chain and Pareto-improvement can be achieved synchronously by the combined contract. In the premise of coordination, the system-wide profit can be allocated arbitrarily only by option price. Through negotiation, the retailer and the manufacturer just need to confirm an appropriate option price to obtain that neither of them becomes worse off. We also find that the manufacturer's loss aversion is a significant element for contract design and profit allocation, and the manufacturer could benefit from its own loss aversion behavior under certain condition. © 2019 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.","Loss aversion; Marketing effort; Option contract; Product quality; Supply chain coordination; VMI","Article","Scopus"

It does so by drawing on an ethnographic research with young men of migrant origins in Turin, Italy, and by addressing the relevance of parkour in the participants’ experiences and negotiations of ‘what it means to (not) belong’ in urban spaces. The focus on parkour provides a unique entry point to address the politics of belonging that unfold in urban spaces as contested sites where competing images of the city, the nation and of who belongs to them converge, clash and overlap. This is particularly relevant, though not limited to the Italian context, where political narratives and realities still legally and socially define the children of migration as alien bodies in the nation, while Turin’s urban leaderships portray youth cultures and multicultural diversity as assets for the city’s symbolic, cultural and financial regeneration. As the intersection of such discourses shapes the manifold ways through which post-migrant urban subjects become essentialised, valorised and pathologised in Turin, the paper’s findings foreground the relevance of informal sports as entry points to (re)consider discussions on citizenship, conviviality and rights (to the city) in contemporary urban contexts. © 2022 The Author(s).

Attitudinal outcomes of i-deals receipt are also examined. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 244 alumni of a Midwestern public university. Findings – The positive relationship between i-deals request and receipt was stronger at higher than at lower levels of LMX. Receiving i-deals was related positively to job satisfaction and affective commitment, and negatively to turnover intention. Research limitations/implications – The authors provide a nuanced perspective of i-deals by separating employees’ request from their receipt of i-deals, and identifying contingent factors that determine whether i-deal requests are successful. Practical implications – For employees, cultivating a strong relationship with one’s supervisor can yield benefits that extend to i-deals negotiation. Providing i-deals to deserving workers can boost employees’ work attitudes. Originality/value – Previous studies have operationalized the i-deals construct as requesting and receiving the deal, thereby excluding the possibility that employees may have requested but did not receive the i-deal. This is one of the first studies to disentangle these two concepts, thereby providing a more balanced and representative view of i-deal-making in organizations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Human capital; I-deals receipt; I-deals request; Idiosyncratic deals (i-deals); Leader-member exchange; Social capital","Article","Scopus"

In the same vein, international trade has traditionally been characterized as the handmaiden of growth. Yet, innovation and trade share a complex relationship. This chapter discusses how innovation-leaders (e.g., the US), innovation-followers (e.g., Brazil), and globalizers (e.g., Vietnam) see the role of trade policies in affecting their innovation strategies. Attention is devoted in particular to the “marriage of convenience” between trade and intellectual property rights (IPRs) laws as negotiated in the context of trade agreements. The experiences of negotiating IPRs protection via multilateral (e.g., TRIPS/WTO) and preferential (e.g., TPP) agreements will be contrasted, and the argument will be made that, even among like-minded countries, these negotiations are inevitably characterized by significant controversy. This chapter also discusses to what extent the increased emphasis on innovation in terms of growth strategies is making the goal of promoting higher standards of IPRs protection easier to advance via trade agreements. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Study level/applicability: This case has been used in 300 and 400 level entrepreneurship courses. Case overview: The case tells the story of John Lee (CEO) and Regina Adams (President), the founders of a new business called global loans in entrepreneurship (GLIE) based in Singapore. GLIE facilitates micro-loans for small business owners in the developing world and specifically targets entrepreneurial development projects for the poor. Many social enterprises start their operations on a shoestring budget. Typically, the deficit of cash pushes the leadership to use creative strategies to move things forward, including recruiting individuals who are willing to work in the startup phase without monetary compensation. This case sheds light on what can happen when founders recruit and rely on a volunteer for essential technology development, vesting the individual with substantial power, and creating the possibility for him/her to delay or purposefully hold up the launch of the company. Expected learning outcomes: The case highlights the importance for someone on the founding team to have whatever core competencies are most critical to the firm. Additional themes are the importance of raising adequate funds at startup, the pitfalls of using volunteers in the wrong capacity, and the disastrous impact the wrong employee can have in a small firm setting.

In thinking about managing the process, it is useful to consider what may be done at the time a task force or team is formed, what needs to be done prior to decision making, and what may be done to integrate information and preferences to make high quality decisions. Table 5 organizes the ideas discussed in this article by stages. An interesting question is how overtly a group leader or member may act in managing this process. Groups themselves do not seem to engage in much deliberate planning. They often jump into their tasks only to back off and plan when they find themselves hopelessly frustrated, such as in the MIS task force in our example. Most groups do not have the luxury of ""team-building"" training-learning techniques to reach high quality group decisions in a simulated environment. So, it is often up to individual group members to direct the group to use processes that will produce high quality decisions. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","","Article","Scopus"

The paper further addresses how agency is related to: (i) organizational and educational transformations, (ii) teachers professional development and identity negotiations and (iii) teachers commitment to the educational organization and well-being at work. This paper provides the comparative research evidence on both the strengths and weaknesses of different management practices of different educational organizations, identified here as a loosely coupled organization and a tightly coupled organization.

Conversely, all these are threatened by teachers weak agency. However, teachers strong agency as individuals also appears to act as a brake on organizational transformation and collective learning.

Whereas most scholarly attention has focused on how domestic politics has interfered with the United States’ global economic leadership, Orin Kirshner offers here an analysis of the ways in which U.S. leadership in the arena of global trade has affected American democracy and the domestic political regime. By participating in multilateral trade agreements, the U.S. Congress has transferred its trade policy–making authority to the president and, through international trade negotiations, from the American state to the GATT/WTO regime. This reorganization of policy-making authority has resulted in the “triumph of globalism,” and fundamentally alters the citizen-state relationship assumed in democratic theory. Kirshner illustrates this process through four case studies: the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1945, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the Trade Act of 1974, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and further examines the impact of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 on the political and institutional structure of American trade politics up to the current period. American Trade Politics and the Triumph of Globalism makes a significant contribution to the study of both international trade and domestic American politics.

To explore the convergence process, we employed a longitudinal, ethnographic research strategy that allowed us to follow a naturally occurring GDT over a 14-month period, producing a rich case study portraying factors and processes that influence convergence. Confirming previous studies, we find that increases in shared cognition alone are not sufficient to account for performance gains on a GDT. Rather, it may be necessary not only to increase the sharing of cognition, but also to reverse a pattern of increasing divergence that can result from rejection of key knowledge domains. We also found that several factors influence the process of cognitive convergence beyond direct knowledge sharing. These include: separate but parallel or similar learning experiences in a common context; the surfacing of hidden knowledge at remote sites by third-party mediators or knowledge brokers; and shifts in agent self-interest that motivate collaboration and trigger the negotiation of task interdependence. Also relevant to cognitive convergence on a GDT is the geographical distribution pattern of people and resources on the ground, and the different ways in which leaders exploit the historical, cultural and linguistic dimensions of such distribution to further their own political agendas. Several propositions related to these observations are suggested. We conclude that GDTs can be effective in bringing together divergent points of view to yield new organizational capabilities, but such benefits require that leaders and members recognize early and explicitly the existence and validity of their differences.

This paper seeks to provide a motivational oriented explanation for understanding alliance instability. Firms may enter into an alliance either with a promotion or a prevention mind set and this can be consequential for alliance development. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw upon regulatory focus theory and its applications in an alliancing context to derive implications for alliance management. Regulatory focus theory is now increasingly being used to explain various types of organizational phenomenon (e.g. contracting, leadership, alliances). The paper distinguishes between a promotion oriented and a prevention oriented mind set and explores the impact of the different mind sets at the alliance formation, operation, and the outcome stage. Findings: A key finding is that different mind sets (promotion vs prevention) affect alliance formation, operation, and outcome. At the formation stage the mind sets may determine the success or failure of negotiations; at the operational stage they may determine if conflicts escalate or deescalate; while at the outcome stage they may determine whether the partners continue with or seek to exit from the alliance. Practical implications: The different motivational orientations have implications for alliance negotiations, the management of the alliance during the operational phase, and/or the decisions that are made by alliancing firms at the outcome phase of the alliance. The paper develops implications for how alliances should be managed for attaining success. Originality/value: The paper should be of interest to alliance managers as it will give them a new lens for understanding the drivers of alliance success and failure. The impact of motivation on alliance success and failure has not been studied to date and this paper provides a novel approach to assessing its impact. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Alliance life cycle; Alliances; Business development; Collaborative intent; Motivation (psychology); Opportunism; Prevention regulatory focus; Promotion regulatory focus; Strategic alliances","Article","Scopus"

Leadership roles in industry associations could benefit the managers' firms in reducing information asymmetry in MA bidding, fostering trust between negotiation parties, and reducing overall deal costs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that firms with professional connections are more likely to successfully complete MA deals and pay smaller acquisition premiums. In additional analyses, we find results indicating that professional connections moderate conditions in the market that are often adversarial to business dealings. Specifically, we find that the beneficial effect of professional connections on MA deals is more pronounced for firms operating in environments where social trust is lower, for firms facing higher level of government intervention, and for non-state-owned firms as compared to state-owned enterprises. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Mergers and acquisitions; Network; Professional connections","Article","Scopus"

Performance management applications have become very popular in public institutions over the past 20 years. Direct accountability to the political institutions and the public is ensured by defining the performance of public administrations according to their organizational goals and objectives. Local governments are using performance management practices to assess the quality of public services offered. In the United Kingdom, performance management practices at the local level were promoted under the leadership of the central government. However, there cannot be a certain standardization or stability in performance management applications. The Best Value (BV) regime was applied primarily in England and Wales. The system was later applied in Scotland in 2003. In 2002, Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) Programme was introduced. Wales preferred to stay outside of this program. The Wales Programme for Improvement (WPI) has adopted self-assessment and holistic assessment. After 2009, the cost-effectiveness of local services was evaluated through comprehensive area assessments. This practice was abolished after 2010, adopting a governance approach based on the common negotiations of local actors. This study aims to evaluate the performance measurement systems applied in the local area in the United Kingdom. © 2018 Demokaan Demirel, published by Sciendo.","Comprehensive Area Assessment; Comprehensive Performance Assessment; The Best Value; United Kingdom; Wales Programme for Improvement","Article","Scopus"

Following this logic, existing scholarship claims that Nordic countries push for tougher regulations to sharpen their competitive advantage. On the basis of an examination of the negotiations over the EU Directive 2014/95/EU, a corporate transparency law that requires firms to report on their social, environmental, and human rights impacts, this paper argues that strong CSR performance does not necessarily entail strong support for regulation. Nordic companies perform well when it comes to sustainability, but except for Denmark, Nordic governments' support for the Directive was lukewarm. To explain why, I examine the dynamics between CSR leaders, business associations, and party politics. I find that business associations are key for explaining this outcome. While some Nordic CSR leaders provided support, business associations, in which SMEs with lower CSR performance comprise the bulk of the members, were forceful opponents of regulation, unless domestic regulations are in place, in which case these associations support supranational regulations to level the playing field. I also stress the importance of partisan politics and extend the analysis to mandatory human rights due diligence. In sum, Nordic countries are much more heterogeneous than what the literature often suggests. © V.K.

These factors may increase relational tensions between managerial-sports leaders (administrators) and the leaders of sports teams (coaches). Few studies have explored the challenges facing coaches when attempting to achieve performance success. Utilising institutional logics and the concepts of trust and power, this study investigated the relationship between coaches and administrators by exploring the various interactions and negotiations involved when in the context of competitive demands. Research methods: The views of thirteen highly experienced cricket coaches, with multi-layered coaching experiences operating in the South African cricket development environment, were recruited for semi-structured interviews, raising several significant themes. Results and findings: A significant challenge to coaches were administrators exhibiting a lack of understanding of the environment required to develop cricketers, providing areas of conflict such as; perceived differences in priorities leading to non-collaborative, ill-judged and, at times biased decisions; differences in priorities affecting resource allocation to drive and sustain long-term development due short-term financial decision-making and result-driven agendas. Implications: Theoretically, this research explores how institutional logics, trust and power enhance our understanding of the coach-administrator relationship and have potential research implications for understanding similar dynamic relationships in other sport organisations. Practically, one implication for sports organisations is the role and importance of developing and applying more effective coach performance management system to alleviate potential problems in these relationships. © 2020 European Association for Sport Management.","coach relationship; Institutional pluralism; South African cricket; trust","Article","Scopus"

Compared to the ""dual-track"" negotiation under Bali mandate, Durban Platform mandate is on ""one-track"". But it does not mean that some parties’ concerns and positions about ""dual-track"" have been adjusted. They are seeking a way to realize their needs in Durban Platform. Therefore, ""one-track"" negotiation on Durban Platform does not simplify problems, but presents problems intensively.At the beginning of Durban Platform mandate, whether to mandate the Durban Platform negotiations was controversial among developing countries, while after consultations, Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the emerging developing economies were divided on main concerns, such as mitigation targets, legal forms, sources of finance mechanism, etc. In fact, AOSIS’s position gradually converged with the European Union (EU), and EU and AOSIS became the most aggressive powers to promote the Durban Platform negotiations. The traditional North-South divergence is facing adjustment, and new powers are restructuring negotiations. The huge disparity of interest among parties hinders progress in the Durban Platform negotiations. Parties will continue to debate and seek consensus on the interpretation of the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"", emission reduction models and targets, sources of finance mechanism, the legal form of the future agreement, etc. With the social and economic development, China is receiving growing attention in the international climate governance processes. China’s status as a developing country is being questioned by some developed and developing countries. Rapid increase of China’s foreign investment and aid attracts worldwide attention, which stimulates the voices and expectations for China to shift its role as a developing country to shoulder more international obligations. However, China should be clearly aware of the fact that China’s power of discourse is still very limited and far from being a leader in the world in various fields, including the international climate governance processes. China’s participation in global climate governance, irrespective of whether its role is being passively changed by others or as a voluntary shift, will still need to keep a lowprofile, strengthen its economy, balance rights and obligations, and commit according to capabilities. © 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

His workman-like approach to scholarship has provided us with the tools needed to contribute to the field. As a broad theorist, Harold inspired us to devote a lifetime in pursuit of knowledge. As a mentor, he imparted the essential skills of writing for publication, presenting at professional meetings, teaching and advising, and contributing to the profession. Above all, his values of interdisciplinary and responsible scholarship have been a hallmark of my own research and project leadership. My work on simulation reflects these values as well, with regard to research platforms and classroom learning. Indeed, a recent article in this journal owes much to Harold's influence (Druckman & Ebner, 2008). © 2011 SAGE Publications.","frameworks; global modeling; Harold Guetzkow; integrative theory; interdisciplinary scholarship; mentoring; negotiation; simulation; values","Article","Scopus"

Central to the Master Plan was the need to adjust the organizational structure to the decentralization of responsibility and to develop new IT applications to support business and management activities. These applications, developed between 1986 and 1992, concerned negotiation, sales/contract management, invoicing/accounts receivable, purchasing management, and accounting.

Over the last 30 years, a substantial body of research has addressed M&A integration, offering rich but widely dispersed insights into this phenomenon. This paper takes stock of the current knowledge, based on a review of articles published in scholarly journals. The review advances the conceptual understanding of the phenomenon by inductively developing an overarching framework for the M&A integration literature, where integration success is a function of context, structural and communication-based interventions, which interact with collective sensemaking processes and negotiations among integration stakeholders. Based on this framework, a research agenda is suggested. I proposes that, in particular, the interaction between structural interventions and leadership warrants further study. Also, little is known about integration project management and integration team composition or the interaction between integration context and collective sensemaking processes. Finally, there is a shortage of research on temporal dynamics within integration projects. The review demonstrates that M&A scholars made substantial progress regarding our understanding of the M&A integration process, yet much remains to be done. © 2016 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","Article","Scopus"

In this paper we describe the development of a women's organization in rural Guatemala that was created to respond to some of the psychological, economic and educational consequences of this war. The Association's genesis and current work reflect collaborative processes of interethnic and transnational non-formal education, community organizing and leadership development. While responding directly to social injustices-including centuries of discrimination and marginalization of indigenous peoples-and the multiple effects of war, the Association provides a context wherein rural Maya women are enhancing self- and community-confidence to act on their own behalf in the development of action plans for change within their local community. In this paper we discuss some of our experiences as insiders in a rural area deeply impacted by war, state violence and poverty, and as outsiders who seek to accompany them in constructing peace with justice at a local level. We document some of the challenges experienced in collaborations across multiple differences as well as their contributions to women's development and to their creation of more just and equitable educational programmes for themselves and children in their communities.","","Article","Scopus"

Our work first examines variables linked to the business project, such as the extent of innovation, extent of investability, speed of acceleration and extent of team consistency. It then assesses entrepreneurial skills such as negotiation, teamwork, creativity, communication and leadership. Our findings show that extent of team consistency and speed of acceleration are the most widely-used variables to assess a business project, while the most valued entrepreneurial skills are leadership followed by creativity.

The weight of American multinationals in the Irish economy has been ever increasing particularly since Ireland’s entry in the European Community in 1973. The country unquestionably owes much of its economic development to these foreign concerns which have proved to be much more embedded in the local economy than one might expect. Boullet demonstrates that despite the severity of the crisis that hit the USA and Ireland in 2007, American investment did not flee Ireland, quite the opposite. As paradoxical as it may seem, the crisis has reinforced economic linkages between the two countries. However, despite the resilience of those ties, a degree of uncertainty remains on their long-term sustainability. Much will depend on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations between the USA and the European Union on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

However, debate surrounding the virtue approach in the business, management and organisational studies literature has lacked progress. First, this literature focuses on a narrow range of philosophers, and, second, it has failed to analyse properly the consequences of virtue theory for action in practical settings other than in abstract terms. In order to begin addressing these issues, this paper compares what two virtue frameworks—one focused on virtue in the context of community and the other on individuals as virtuous agents—lead to when evaluating the actions of parties to the 2002–2004 UK Fire Service dispute. The analysis argues that the virtue frameworks proposed by MacIntyre and Slote offer different but complimentary evaluations. Both not only point to potential problems with industrial disputes, but also recognise the legitimacy of action that is based in good motivations and carried out with regard for the virtues. It seems that fire fighters and their immediate supervisors, on the whole, met the conditions of virtue, but that it is open to question if the leaders of the Fire Brigades Union and the Government did the same. The analysis goes on to suggest which modes of negotiation would be acceptable under the virtue frameworks, and the implications for those involved in industrial dispute. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Employee relations; Fire fighters; Industrial action; MacIntyre; Negotiation; Slote; Strike; Virtue ethics","Article","Scopus"

If the challenge of management is making decisions in situations of uncertainty, Coffee and Conflict in Colombia is the ultimate test of finding business solutions in extremely volatile situations. Based on firsthand experience on-site and years of rigorous research, this book leverages a real-world case of a global coffee consortium facing the challenge of negotiating wages for its farmworkers during a low-intensity conflict in and around Colombia. Beyond the direct consequences of the negotiation, many farmworkers are ready to join local militia if a wage deal cannot be reached, thereby fueling the cycle of local instability and violence. Putting readers in the role of consultants to a client operating in the area lets them experience defining moments of managing this high-stakes situation with limited information and considerable time pressure. Almost as if ""parachuting"" into an escalating conflict scenario, readers form critical relationships with characters that introduce them to management tools and techniques they need to arrive at a successful conclusion. The excitement and intensity of Coffee and Conflict in Colombia equips business leaders of today and tomorrow with valuable know-how they can apply to the uncertainties of everyday business in an international context. © 2020 Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.","","Book","Scopus"

What are the relevant and responsible contributions that corporations are expected to provide in support of defining solutions to sustainability issues? This paper shows how corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a negotiation process to help corporations manage uncertainties through collaborative work and alignment with stakeholders. From that angle, CSR is a process that generates standard and acceptable business practices. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses both an adductive as well as an interpretative approach of CSR and looks at CSR as a collaborative process that builds rules and norms. Findings: CSR is defined as a contractual process between stakeholders in order to drive decision making processes and agree on commitments between business and society. Interestingly, all studied examples depict the development of standard and acceptable business practices with very little involvement of stakeholders, which is not the understood way of driving changes to business strategy as defined by the CSR negotiation processes. Practical implications: A framework is presented linking CSR business practices research findings to empirical market isomorphism. The paper is of practical relevance for management practitioners. The limitations of recent research are also discussed. Originality/value: Our examples show that CSR is no more than the achievements of fragmented initiatives led by companies showing limited transparency toward external stakeholders. There is no overall coordination. The paper is original in its recommendation that public authorities play a strategic role showing clear direction, and establish themselves as a strategic platform enabling more engagement between stakeholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","CSR business practices; Institutionalism; Isomorphism; Negotiation; Network organization; Stakeholder theory","Article","Scopus"

Cashing In on Cyberpower addresses the question, Why and to what end are state and nonstate actors using cybertools to influence economic outcomes? The most devastating uses of cyberpower can include intellectual property theft, espionage to uncover carefully planned trade strategies, and outright market manipulation through resource and currency values. Offering eight hypotheses to address this central question, Mark T. Peters II considers every major cyberattack (almost two hundred) over the past ten years, providing both a quick reference and a comparative analysis. He also develops new case studies depicting the 2010 intellectual property theft of a gold-detector design from the Australian Codan corporation, the 2012 trade negotiation espionage in the Japanese Trans-Pacific Partnership preparations, and the 2015 cyberattacks on Ukrainian SCADA systems. All these hypotheses combine to identify new data and provide a concrete baseline of how leaders use cybermeans to achieve economic outcomes. © 2018 by the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

The transformation began with the desire and commitment of local political leaders to achieve much better design quality than had been experienced in previous decades.

Significantly, these refusals were backed up at public inquiry by independent inspectors. Over time, speculative developers came to realise that they would be excluded from profitable development opportunities in the town if they failed to take design more seriously.

I do not find any empirical evidence that these treaties drive migration. However, BLAs have statistically significant effects on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and exports, suggesting other important channels through which these agreements affect economic outcomes.

The EU emerges as an actor able to export regulatory standards, improve the status of its trade partner within multilateral forums and, at the same time, respect the local ownership of the development process. At the same time, it is criticized for the lack of coherence in its foreign policy, its internal divisions and intrusiveness in Vietnamese domestic politics. Moreover, differences emerge in the way government and non-governmental actors portray the EU, further challenging its univocal representation as a political leader. These perceptions have implications concerning the EU’s ability to export its constitutive principles and values to Vietnam.

Despite geographic proximity, cultural similarities and high efficiency of economic interactions, current state of the US-Canada trade cooperation worsens due to the ambitions of the USA as a global economic leader, alongside with unresolved trade disputes and increasing deficit of trade in goods and services. According to the analysis of the US-Canada external trade, it was concluded that due to long-lasting trade, the related supply chains have become highly integrated. The USA buys mostly raw materials and semi-finished products which are then used in finished products designated for internal and external markets. A lot of them even are sold back to Canada. However, there is a controversy in the USA and Canada interests. The USA seeks, first of all, to keep the world leading economic positions, to expand duty-free market available for the sales of domestic producers etc. Canada intends to get rid of protectionist restrictions presumed in American legislation and, thus, to increase the competitiveness of its producers' of goods at the US markets. Estimating the coefficient of trade connectivity, which is bigger than 1, it was evidenced that both countries, in case of trade relations’ worsening or break, will be hardly reoriented on other partners. Our regression analysis shows that Canada’s GDP positively depends on Canadian exports to the USA, while the subsequent permanent increase in Canada’s exports to the USA is forecasted. However, it had been argued that the perspectives of future cooperation hardly depend on the results of negotiation regarding NAFTA reforming which turned into USMCA. Despite the positive conclusion of negotiations on NAFTA's reform and its transformation into USMCA/CUSMA, Canada still has to come up with a more rational policy in order not to become the fifty-first state of the US within the currency and, then, political union. © Foundation of International Studies, 2019 & © CSR, 2019.","Canada; Coefficient of trade connectivity; Exports; Globalization; NAFTA; Regional integration unions; The USA; USMCA","Article","Scopus"

Although it is estimated that a majority of planned union mergers are never completed, the existing literature is unsuccessful in explaining why it is so. Stressing the importance for merging unions to keep their members informed and participative in the merger process, we highlight two democratic aspects of merger implementation: information anchoring (i.e. the spreading of merger relevant information throughout the membership), and participatory union climate (i.e. the extent to which union leaders provide members with opportunities to participate in union activities and decision making). The act of voting for or against a merger proposal can be regarded as a manifestation of democratic aspects in the internal negotiation process. Thus, members' intention to vote for or against the merger proposal was also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaires were sent to 1,000 members of each of the four participating unions. The survey investigated how many members knew of the merger negotiations, if they would have voted for or against the proposal, and also measured perceptions of the participatory union climate. Discrepancies between representatives and rank-and-file members were analyzed, with any significant differences between the two groups interpreted as indicative of the merger process lacking in internal democracy. Findings – The results show that the merger plans were not sufficiently anchored among the membership and that there were significant differences between representatives and rank-and-file members in terms of merger plan awareness, vote intention, and perceptions of participatory union climate. Research limitations/implications – The present study is based on cross-sectional data collected after the planned merger was rejected. Originality/value – Few studies have investigated the internal merger negotiation process using an unsuccessful merger attempt as a study case. Also, the need for psychological approaches in IR has long been called for.

As a reaction to this, some advanced business leaders have initiated various actions and projects with their companies, and various regulations have been introduced by governments with varying levels of effectiveness. In this context of a mix of international initiatives, media attention, customer irritation, diverse regulatory changes and partial political lethargy, ever more companies are challenged to identify and reduce their exposure to climate change issues. Whereas the reduction of climate change emissions is an important topic, it has also become obvious that climate change is not just a future risk but is already happening. This invokes adaptation activities in addition to mitigation strategies and measures. A basic requirement to design the corporate climate strategy is the knowledge about the company’s exposure as well as about options, effects and costs of emission reductions and adaptation measures. This is where climate change accounting as a specific kind of environmental management accounting comes into play.

One is ‘downsizing’, which often accompanies the lean production method, and the other is ‘stakeholder satisfaction’, which has been proven to increase the probability of a firm's long-term success. Stakeholder satisfaction also mitigates the negative impacts from downsizing. This research examines how institutional legitimacy influences the union stakeholders in their strategy selection during corporate downsizing. A quantitative survey was deployed, followed by a qualitative exploration of the phenomenon uncovered in the survey. The research findings showed an overwhelming conditioning effect of institutions which led a majority of labour unions to select a direct negotiation strategy as their reaction to business downsizing decisions. Institutional factors such as legal requirement, social expectation, well-publicised best practices, etc., dominated union leaders' decision on the best initial influence strategy. The findings carry practical implications for firms in managing the quality of labour relations during business downsizing and also contribute to the affirmation of institutional factors as an important dimension of stakeholder influence strategy theory. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","downsizing; institutional factor; labour union; stakeholder influence strategy; Taiwan","Article","Scopus"

This focus upon ‘order’ undervalues conflict-ridden negotiations and power struggles in temporary organizing. This paper demonstrates that in temporary organizing conflict and order may exist in tandem. Drawing close to the collaborative dynamics in a large-scale global project, we analyse the political struggles over role patterns and hierarchic positioning of client and agent in the temporary organization of the Panama Canal Expansion Program (PCEP). In such projects, the agent typically takes the position of project leader. In this case however, the client was formally in charge, while the agent was assigned the role of coach and mentor. The diffuse hierarchy triggered project partners to engage in both harmony-seeking social and discursive practices and to enter into conflict-ridden negotiations over authority relations in the everyday execution of the PCEP project. Our study contributes to existing literatures on temporal organizing by presenting a case of simultaneous practices of harmonization and contestation over mutual roles and hierarchic positions. We also show that studying collaboration between project partners involves, not merely analysing project governance structures, but also offering a context-sensitive account of everyday social and discursive practices. Finally, we reflect on a view of ‘permanence’ and ‘temporariness’ as themselves contested categories and symbolic sites for struggle. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","collaboration; ethnography; governance; megaproject; project-based; projects; temporary organization","Article","Scopus"

The first company, United Airlines (UAL), awash in debt, filed for bankruptcy in 2002. Until its bankruptcy filing, UAL had hoped for government loan guarantees to bail it out. When these guarantees failed to materialize, UAL was left owning a fleet of planes twice the size it needed, (Cite: Disunited) paying wages pursuant to an uncompetitive union wage structure, and experiencing shrinking revenues due in part to lower air travel post 9/11. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and emerged as a new company in 2006. General Motors (GM), the second company, also faced the possibility of bankruptcy in 2008. At that time, it operated a number of manufacturing plants manned by unionized American employees who earned tens of dollars per hour more than GM's international competitors. This considerable wage/benefit cost disadvantage coupled with a shrinking revenue base, aging manufacturing capacity, more dealers than it needed, and rising debt levels pushed GM towards bankruptcy. At the end of 2008, GM too awaited a government bailout. This case looks at financial and operating restructuring opportunities available to a company through bankruptcy. First, the case looks at interest savings achieved by UAL after emerging frombankruptcy. The case posits the question, are these savings (attributed to UAL's lower levels of debt),. available to GM if it filed for bankruptcy protection? This case also looks at the operating cost savings demonstrated by UAL following emergence from bankruptcy. Although in a different industry, the case leads students through calculations of operating cost savings potentially available to GM through bankruptcy. These include costs such as wages, benefits, and supplier costs (if GM follows the UAL model). Finally, the case looks at issues pertaining to organized labor and, in particular, legacy costs. These costs are credited with handicapping and diminishing the competitiveness of both American auto manufacturers and older airlines worldwide. ""Legacy costs"" is the term used for worker pensions and health care benefits that were negotiated in past collective bargaining agreements and incurred by the organization under different leadership or when the organization's priorities and resources were different (Cooney, 2002, 2005). Because of benefits established and enhanced through several decades of collective bargaining, the automobile industry finds itself supporting a large number of retirees and health care beneficiaries (Cooney, 2002, 2005). Along with legacy costs, American autoworkers remain among the highest paid manufacturing workers in the world; sometimes paid when they do not work via the ""jobs bank"". The ""jobs bank"" is a program which gives American automobile union workers most of their pay and benefits while they are laid off, eliminating the need for such employees to seek unemployment benefits (Langlois, 2009). Another potential source of financial woe for the American auto industry is executive compensation. Rick Wagoner, CEO for GM, is paid a yearly compensation totaling around 14.4 million (Farago, 2008, Forbes, 2009). Many hate to see a wealthy CEO making millions of dollars with a golden parachute for running a company that might ultimately declare bankruptcy. Therefore, this case addresses the implications of managerial decision-making especially negotiations with union representatives' demands and/or concessions that are potentially needed to ultimately keep the American automobile industry solvent and competitive. The case has a difficulty level of 4-5 and is recommended for college seniors and first year MBA students. With three major categories of issues covered (interest savings achievable through bankruptcy, operating cost savings achievable through bankruptcy, and issues related to bankruptcy and labor unions), it is expected the case will take three hours of class time. Students aware of current business events (such as the potential government bailout of GM) will require little or no outside preparation. Students who are unaware of the potential GM government bailout will need to review current business periodical articles on General Motors. Total outside of class preparation should not exceed one hour. (Note: Whenever possible, company financial data was taken directly from company published financial reports. When amounts were not specifically disclosed, estimates were used, based upon actual disclosed data.) Case Synopsis: It is early 2008. The GM board of directors is meeting to discuss 2007 financial results. The results are not good. The company is preparing to announce that it just lost $38 billion and is $184 billion in debt. You, as a board member, have heard management's explanations of the losses for sometime now. You know that GM has too many manufacturing facilities, but union contracts prevent it from shutting them down. You know the average hourly wage/benefit package of a GM factory worker is $30 per hour higher than its non-union competition. However, union contracts bar it from cutting employee and retiree medical/pensionosts that cause the cost differential. Management has some good news. Sales are up and cost control efforts are starting to pay off. Some of the unprofitable GM dealerships are closing which is good news as you have too many dealers. However, the company is running out of cash. Management reports that under current conditions, it may have enough cash through 2009. However, if a recession occurs, it may be out of cash in 2008. Discussion turns to government bailouts. Board members bristle at government intervention when discussion focuses on the strings which may be attached. Finally, a board member mentions the ""B"" word, and suggests filing bankruptcy and getting a resh start. (Several airlines have done it and are up, operating, and profitable.) Members squirm in their chairs as a different board member discusses her experience with another bankrupt company. You are uneasy and ask management to investigate GM's options. This case leads students through a three pronged approach of applying the airline bankruptcy model to GM. Discussion questions focus students on bankruptcy's potential impacts on debt and interest, operating costs, and labor unions.

The purpose of this paper is to propose and test a compensatory model in which service employees’ emotion recognition ability helps enhance their job performance, particularly when employees score low on the agreeableness personality dimension or have low cognitive ability. Design/methodology/approach – With a two-wave multisource dataset collected from a service center of a large retail bank, multiple regression analysis was used to test the moderating roles of agreeableness and cognitive ability on the relationship between service employees’ emotion recognition ability and their performance. Findings – Service employees’ emotion recognition ability helped enhance their job performance. However, the positive effect of emotion recognition ability on job performance was only statistically significant when employees’ agreeableness or cognitive ability was low. Practical implications – The findings have important implications for how service organizations select and recruit employees. In particular, service employees with low agreeableness or cognitive ability may still be able to perform well when possessing high emotion recognition ability.

Meanwhile, the demand for new, effective medical and drug treatments continues to rise as unhealthy lifestyles cause further increases in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Global drug pricing is one of the most hotly debated yet least understood aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. How should drug prices be set and what does it mean for patients? Why do governments increasingly get involved, and what is its impact on the global competitive environment? How can a life-saving industry have a poorer image than gun and tobacco industries, whose products are associated with death? Ed Schoonveld explains how pharmaceutical prices are determined in a complex global payer environment and what factors influence the process. His insights will help a wide range of audiences, from healthcare industry professionals to policy makers and the broader public, to gain a better understanding of this highly complex and emotionally charged field. The Price of Global Health is recognized as a valued and unique reference book that covers a complete array of topics related to global pharmaceutical pricing. It contains an in-depth but straightforward exploration of the pharmaceutical pricing strategy process, its underlying market access, general business and ethical considerations, and its implications for payers, physicians and patients. It is a much-needed and invaluable resource for anybody interested or involved in, or affected by, the development, funding and use of prescription drugs. In particular, it is of critical importance to pharmaceutical company executives and other leaders and professionals in commercialization and drug development, including marketing, business development, market access and pricing, clinical development, drug discovery, regulatory affairs, health outcomes, market research and public affairs. The second edition includes new chapters on payer value story development, oncology, orphan drugs and payer negotiations. Furthermore, many country chapters have been substantially updated to reflect changes in the healthcare systems, including the Affordable Care Act in the US, AMNOG in Germany, medico-economic requirements in France and many other country-specific changes. Lastly, almost every chapter has been updated with new examples and illustrations. © Ed Schoonveld 2015.","","Book","Scopus"

Centered on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the paper aims to contribute to the understanding of factors that affect EIs of students and offer some important insight into unique aspects of TVETs to empower youth and adults to actively engage in entrepreneurial initiatives. Design/methodology/approach – A survey with a sample size of 107 TEVT students, taking part in four key programs, participated in this study using Entrepreneurial Intention Questionnaires. Linear and hierarchical regression were applied to test the hypotheses. Findings – The findings indicate that the two most predictable variables of EI were personal attitude toward behavior and perceived behavioral control. Hence, it was suggested that proper care should be taken in the way curricula and content are designed. It is also highlighted that the educational practice needs adjustment to include course contents like decision making, effective communication, entrepreneurial negotiation, leadership, effective and efficient use of sources, new product development, creativity and critical thinking, and service-based and technological innovation. Practical implications – Policy makers in developing countries are trying to address the critical developmental concerns of unemployment, rural-urban imbalance, industrialization, capital formation, and labor utilization. Vocational education is seen as a policy instrument to promote economic and social progress using entrepreneurship education. However, in order for institutions to play this key role, their skill formation process needs to be geared toward enhancing and developing traits associated with entrepreneurial success. This study has confirmed that TVET programs are required to reach a balanced spectrum of delivering entrepreneurial skills through intensive engagement with partners and effective mobilization of interest groups if they are to boost economic and social change. Originality/value – This study applies the TPB in an effort to understand determinants of EI on technical and vocational education. It invites academics and policy makers to rethink the approach adopted in entrepreneurship education in the vocational set up. It questions TVET programs’ roles in preparing students for self-employment, networking or partnership efforts, and the design of curricula as a process and entrepreneurial skill as an outcome of entrepreneurial education. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial intentions; Technical-vocational education and training; Theory of planned behaviour","Article","Scopus"

The resource-based view suggests that strategic partnerships between firms have the potential to create value when resources are pooled together. Scott Crump faces a decision-making situation wherein he analyses the value-creation potential of the original equipment manufacturer partnership with Hewlett-Packard (HP). In addition, contrasting the cultural environments within both organizations would bring in greater complexity and depth to the reflections, analyses and discussions. Often research experts explore these concepts in isolated streams of research. However, in real-world scenarios, these aspects must be integrated for a more comprehensive decision making to take place. It is also recommended for students to analyze how founder characteristics and resources imprint organizations with certain enduring “imprints” that determine strategic outcomes for the firm in unique ways. Research methodology: For the development of this case, the authors interviewed the top management at Stratasys including Scott Crump, Founder and CEO. The authors also interviewed former and current employees of Stratasys, HP, other experts in the printing industry and existing customers in the 3D printing industry. The company made internal documents available to the authors including financial statements, internal meeting presentations, company forecasts and assessment tools. All interviews were recorded and analyzed to obtain and include multiple perspectives from various stakeholders. The authors also conducted extensive online research on the 3D printing industry and utilized data from news articles, interviews and other relevant press materials. Case overview/synopsis: Scott Crump, Founder of Stratasys, a company that developed and sold 3D printers, had always envisioned a future when it would be commonplace for a 3D printer to be on the desk of every engineer. HP approached him with a proposal that had the potential to make that dream come true. Crump knew that Stratasys did not need to partner with HP for a financial reason, but he loved the idea of the technology becoming a standard method for creating parts universally. The case highlights a true-life account of a firm’s founder considering an important strategic alliance and analyzing the ramifications of taking on or refusing this partnership. Complexity academic level: This case has applications in strategic management and small business management courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels. It also contains critical areas of decision making relevant to an advanced strategic management course that focuses on manufacturing strategy or strategic alliance decision making. This case would be relevant to MBA, Executive MBA or Masters of Science in Accountancy level students as well. Specifically, it is intended for use in courses involving topics such as mergers and strategic partnerships, negotiation and leadership, risk analysis, financial statement analysis, financial modeling and market analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural fit; Decision making; Imprinting; Strategic alliance","Article","Scopus"

The qualitative data are collected from semi-structured interviews with key organizational members. Besides, the study also relies on various publicly available documents and the Local Government Acts to complement the interview data. Findings: The findings of the study divulge dependence on partisan aligned nonprogrammable government funds poses significant problems for municipal organizations in carrying out their budgetary process. Clientelism and informal negotiations of incumbent political leaders are found to play a vital role in such resource sharing decisions. The consequent uncertainties in getting funds have the potentials of interrupting the budgetary process at the organizational level. In some cases, budgets do not appear to be useful as a management tool for guiding organizational activities. Research limitations/implications: Like other qualitative studies, the results of these case studies are not generalizable because their interpretations are highly dependent on the context of the research sites. Practical implications: Despite the limitation of a case study research, the results of this study are useful to deepen our understanding of how uncertainty in resource sharing creates clientele behavior and interferes with the organizational budget.

The 12 TPP countries signed the agreement in February 2016, but the agreement required ratification by each country before it could enter into force. In the United States, this required implementing legislation by Congress. Upon taking office, President Trump withdrew the United States from the TPP and halted further negotiations on the T-TIP, but may reengage in the TPP under different terms. The remaining 11 partners to the TPP concluded, without U.S. participation, a revised TPP, now identified as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Trump Administration is also attempting to revise the two largest existing U.S. FTAs, through the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and modification talks regarding the U.S.-South Korea (KORUS) FTA. President Trump has addressed trade broadly and trade agreements more directly through an assertive trade enforcement agenda and vocal skepticism of past U.S. trade agreements and the potential benefits of trade. The Trump Administration has characterized U.S. trade agreements as unfair and detrimental to the economy, a viewpoint that is not shared by U.S. trading partners, established economic analysis, and various business and consumer groups. For some observers, the growing globalization of the economy raises concerns that the cost of U.S. leadership in the global arena is outstripping the benefits of U.S. global engagement. Others argue that the United States needs to renegotiate its role and require others to share more of the costs. The Trump Administration’s approach does not rule out the possibility that some countries are not fully abiding by international trade agreements and rules. Such actions may distort market performance and erode public support for the international trade system. Discussions of FTAs often focus on trade balances, particularly U.S. bilateral merchandise trade balances with its FTA partner countries, as one way of measuring the success of the agreements. Although bilateral merchandise trade balances can provide a quick snapshot of the U.S. trade relationship with a particular country, most economists argue that such balances serve as incomplete measures of the comprehensive nature of the trade and economic relationship between the United States and its FTA partners. Indeed, current trade agreements include trade in services, provisions for investment, and trade facilitation, among others that are not reflected in bilateral merchandise trade balances. This chapter presents data on U.S. merchandise (goods) trade with its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partner countries. The data are presented to show bilateral trade balances for individual FTA partners and groups of countries representing such major agreements as the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement and Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR) relative to total U.S. trade balances. This chapter also discusses the issues involved in using bilateral merchandise trade balances as a standard for measuring the economic effects of a particular FTA. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach: The unique bilateral data set consists of 861 country pairs. Country reputation measures are from a global survey, in which respondents in 20 countries rate the reputation for products and people of 50 other countries. This data set is then analyzed against actual export data for each country-pair using the well-established structural gravity model of international trade. Findings: The authors find that each improvement in a world ranking of a country’s reputation for products (in a target country) is associated with a 2 percent increase in exports to that particular country; the effect is equivalent to the importing country decreasing a tariff by as much as 2.9 percent. Furthermore, the authors find that different aspects of country reputation – for its products and its people – attenuate distinct forms of uncertainty, and thereby stimulate export volume in distinct ways. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that the relationship between country reputation and export volume is a substantive and empirically valid topic of study. For public policy makers looking to stimulate exports to a specific country, improving their respective country’s reputation in that country appears to be a viable alternative to other levers (e.g. trade negotiations, free trade agreements). For business leaders at international companies, the findings suggest that companies may consider country reputation as a factor when choosing to which countries they wish to expand. Originality/value: The notion that country reputation can contribute to aggregate export volume has intuitive appeal. Yet, aside from research on country-of-origin effects which has concentrated on the individual consumer level, the notion of country reputation contributing to aggregate effects has so far been based mostly on conjecture and anecdotal evidence. This is the only study to the authors’ knowledge that empirically tests this relationship using a bilateral measure of reputation as a determinant of export volume within one of the most successful empirical frameworks, the structural gravity model of international trade. The findings suggest that for many countries, their reputation may contribute to billions of dollars in export volume. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Empirical study; Exports; Imports; Trade","Article","Scopus"

Despite such major shifts in the relationship between Japan and Europe, it is unfortunately true that Japanese society does not have a high level of interest in establishing a cooperative relationship or negotiating agreements such as the SPA with the EU, in fields other than economics. However, this low level of interest does not mean that strengthening a political relationship with the EU is unimportant. Rather, confirming that Japan and the EU share the basic values promoted by the SPA is even more important now than it was in 2011, when both leaders decided to initiate SPA and EPA negotiations. The international order—based on values such as liberty, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the market economy, and free trade—which has been built up by Western countries, including Japan, since the end of the Second World War, is being challenged not only by emerging countries such as China but also by the Trump Administration in the United States. Japan-Europe relations after World War II have historically been dominated by economic friction, especially in the 1960s–1980s. But the experiences involved in resolving the economic friction enabled the relations to evolve from economic interests to the other area. There was a qualitative transformation of the relationship between Japan and Europe in the 1990s.

Nonetheless, improving the quality of education, including sustainability, has become a policy focus since the Tbilisi Declaration and, more recently, in the Sustainable Development Goals. How to increase the contribution of higher education to sustainability is the subject of a robust debate, not only in terms of graduates’ competencies but also in its linkages to society at large. The objective of the paper is to identify the main concerns and proposed strategies in recent literature on this topic to elucidate how to overcome the gap between the actions and desires of international institutions and stakeholders. A systematic review of the literature in the last five years supported with the PRISMA workflow and a check of natural processing language was undertaken. Five main topics were identified, including economic effects from higher education, social impacts, pedagogical-related issues, higher education institutions’ environmental behaviour, and their structural challenges when implementing sustainability. The analysis indicated that institutions have focused on environmental measures but have paid scant attention to society, their communities, collaboration with other institutions, changes in the training of managers and lecturers and the proper assessment of internal structures that drive the commitment of institutions and education to embrace sustainability. Drawing from the literature, a set of five strategies is recommended to lessen the reported problems and further embrace sustainability in higher education. Hence, innovation in management, planning, openness, training of stakeholders in sustainability, negotiation, and building multipartner networks seem to be the key drivers for adopting sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Higher education; Higher education institutions; Innovation; PRISMA; Sustainability; Systematic review","Review","Scopus"

Is this book a cookbook for success of a modern women’s career? Probably not; even the most accomplished women don’t claim to have followed a formulaic path to success. What Hamerstone and Musser Hough do is help a young woman think about what her satisfying career might really look like and provide a unifying framework for how to get there. Appropriate for a young woman just entering the workforce up through a woman in mid-career (who doesn’t have time to read a dozen different books on various narrow career topics), Successfully Navigating a Profession lays out the key elements of a successful career in a concise and logical manner. Those elements include core skills - Leadership, Communication, Negotiation as well as Networking, Mentoring, Career Path Navigation, Work-Life Fit, and Personal Brand. Each topic includes a summary of key research and leading thought on these issues and is infused with examples and commentary from successful women gathered through interviews the authors conducted with women of all ages in corporate, government, and non-for-profit organizations. Most importantly, each chapter answers the ‘So What Does this Mean for Me?’ question by offering realistic, concrete suggestions for how women can Successfully Navigate a Profession. The authors offer a unique blend of practical and academic experiences that provides the reader with a framework to successfully navigate her career in today’s economy. © James Hamerstone and Lindsay Musser Hough, 2013.","","Book","Scopus"

The tourism literature places great importance on the cultural industries and the growth of cultural tourism in countries like Australia. But the link between immigration, ethnic diversity, and tourism, which we call ethnic tourism, in Australia and elsewhere has received little attention by scholars. By ethnic tourism we mean not only the tourism by ethnic minorities to countries like Australia but also the way that nonminority tourists - in Australia, this means British, New Zealand, and North American tourists - are attracted to ethnic tourist sites such as ethnic precincts. The cosmopolitan character of Australia's largest cities, a result of the great ethnic diversity of Australia's immigration intake over the past 60 years, has lead to the development of ethnic tourism, a subset of cultural tourism. Ethnic tourism thus includes tourism to destinations that are labeled, marketed, and identified with the cultural diversity of a particular minority ethnic group. Ethnic precincts such as Chinatown, Little Italy, Thaitown, and Koreatown attract customers who are locals, national tourists, or international tourists to experience the ""ethnic neighborhoods"" of the city. These customers are often attracted by the presence of ethnic businesses - restaurants, shops, services - set up by ethnic entrepreneurs. Some tourists may be seeking an ""authentic"" ethnic experience in the precinct. This may involve the quality and style of food, the smells and sounds arising from restaurants, the presence of locals and ""co - ethnic"" customers and staff, and the decor and iconography of the streetscape, buildings, and landmarks. Ethnic communities and local governments may also hold ethnic festivals and events which attract both tourists and locals. Focusing on the links between immigration, ethnic diversity, and tourism, this article concentrates on the supply side of one site of the ethnic tourism industry in Australia: that of ethnic precincts in Australian cities. Drawing on recent fieldwork with tourists, entrepreneurs, ethnic community leaders, and local and state government officials in two metropolitan ethnic precincts (Sydney's Chinatown and Perth's Northbridge), this article explores some critical dimensions of the interface between immigration, ethnic diversity, and tourism. The positioning of ethnic precincts as tourism products includes contradictory and complex issues of authenticity, employment, the representation of ethnicity, consultation with migrant communities, negotiations with local government authorities, and marketing and promotion activities. The article concludes that while historical patterns of immigration and immigrant settlement have changed over time, ethnie precincts are important, though changing, sites of urban ethnic tourism in Australia and thus fertile sites to begin to understand the complex and changing links between immigration, ethnic diversity, and tourism in contemporary cosmopolitan cities.

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews with practising managers and directors of Chinese companies were used to access the tacit message in HR practices cases and to capture the personal stories provided by Chinese managers with rich working experiences on HRM, in order to discover the cultural fundamentals beneath the surface of HR practices and so disclose their underlying significance. The data for the study were collected through in-depth interviews with 21 top managers and HR managers in Chinese companies about the role of Chinese fuzzy thinking in Chinese HRM practices. Findings: The results show that in HRM practices, the principle of Zhongyong significantly affects: preference in recruitment and selection practices; the preferred way of communication and negotiation; the relationship between superiors and subordinates and the relationship among employees; and the leadership styles. Research limitations/implications: The research limitation mainly lies in an insufficient sample size, undivided geographical area and inadequate classification of the Chinese enterprises.

However, there are many aspects of the human security approach relating to agency that need to be sharpened in order to make the concept workable from a gender studies perspective, especially when one looks at the concept from the point of view of women within conflict and post-conflict situations. Gender relations within the context of conflict are one such set of social relations that reveal the complexities embedded within the notion of agency. Civil conflict breaks open, pathologizes, distorts and can even transform societal rifts, making it all the more important that we problematize the meaning of agency. First, we need to consider the agents themselves. What is meant by “people” in human security approaches needs to be clarified, especially where there are multiple and competing interests of different “people” that are embedded in power relations. Men and women do not always have the same motivations and objectives in processes like peacemaking. This chapter looks at differences between men and women in peacebuilding activities. It asks: Why have women’s peacemaking activities differed so significantly from those of men in most African conflicts? Why have women been relegated primarily to localized peacemaking efforts? Why has it been so hard for them to participate in national peacekeeping negotiations and initiatives that are generally dominated by men? Second, agency itself is not neutral and can serve multiple and competing purposes, both for ill and for good. One reality is that war and other forms of insecurity make people act in ways they would never dream of doing under normal circumstances in order to stay alive. Even peace activists-more than is often acknowledged-cut unholy deals and collaborate with “the enemy” in order to survive. Some women in Liberia accepted top positions within government ministries of the corrupt and autocratic Charles Taylor government in order to advance their careers personally, but also because they felt that this positioned them better to negotiate for peace and advance gender-related goals. Theft, corruption and deceit are rampant during conflict. Agency is often described in positive terms, but the realities of conflict may make agency a more ambiguous concept. During the Liberian women’s peace movement, a few so-called peace activists associated with President Charles Taylor allegedly tried to ambush and kill the leaders of the movement during one effort to engage and disarm soldiers. To be clear, many women who had been associated with the Taylor government or who had supported Taylor belonged to the peace movement, but only a few resorted to such tactics. Third, the more severe the circumstances, the more agency becomes problematic. How, for example, should one understand agency when the actions of one victimized group result in the suffering and misery of others? What is the meaning of agency when women use what little agency they have simply to survive through whatever brutal means is available to them? Kidnapped girl child soldiers in Sierra Leone found that the more violent and ruthless they were in their attacks on civilian populations, the more privileges they attained in the context where they themselves were victims of physical and other insecurities. Some girl soldiers used their fighting skills to defend themselves by killing combatants who tried to rape them. Fourth, what is the meaning of agency when the solution is almost as bad as the problem, creating its own set of dilemmas? For example, women, girls and combatants sometimes use marriage and exchange sexual relations with fighters for survival and protection. Some scholars have described these survival strategies in terms of agency (Maclure and Denov, 2006; Denov and Gervais, 2007). Fifth, human security approaches often tend to focus on the individual as both the means and the end of human security (Buzan, 2004: p. 37; Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, 2007: p. 238). In practice, the way problems are framed have often resulted in statist solutions, e.g., by focusing on individual agency and the rights of the individual (Krause and Williams, 1997: p. 46; Richmond, 2007; Ambrosetti, 2008; Christie, 2010). This is premised on a liberal notion of rights as being located primarily with the individual. Yet agency is not only enacted by individuals. It often takes collective forms. Both individual and collective actors need to be accounted for. Women’s demands to participate in peace negotiations were almost always made as a collective and were made in order to advance a women’s rights agenda to benefit women as a collectivity because they were perceived as a group to be marginalized, particularly in context of war. In fact, conflict exacerbated the consequences of women’s exclusions, making it all the more imperative to make demands as a collectivity. Moreover, women’s agency, like that of others, is largely defined or constrained by the broader gendered social structures within which women operate. Gender-based discrimination sets parameters on women’s action. This chapter looks at why and how women seek to challenge those parameters and redefine agency collectively along more egalitarian lines in the context of war, with particular reference to Liberia. By “integrating a gender perspective into the concept of human security rather than applying human security to gender,” as Hoogensen and Stuvoy (2006: p. 219) suggest, it becomes easier to adopt a more people-centered approach to security and appreciate the important ways in which women on the ground are collectively taking measures to address their vulnerabilities and claim a voice through political representation. Although rarely acknowledged by the press, academics or policy makers, women and women’s organizations in Africa-from Sierra Leone to Liberia, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda-have been actively engaged in peacebuilding activities at the local levels. Many of the most important and least recognized ways women engaged in peacemaking in Liberia, for example, involved a wide variety of peacemaking tactics, organizing rallies and boycotts, letter writing to international agencies, promoting small arms confiscation and negotiating with rebels to release abducted child soldiers. These activities gained virtually no recognition by national, regional and international bodies when it came to constructing peace negotiation delegations, which suggests that women’s activities have often been relegated to the more informal, localized and private domains. This necessitates paying attention to the ways in which women have actually pursued peace, but also attending to the fact that women have been left out of the more formal peace negotiations. © 2012 Howard Stein and Amal Hassan Fadlalla","","Book chapter","Scopus"

If the President negotiates an international trade agreement that would reduce tariff or non-tariff barriers to trade in ways that require changes in U.S. law, the United States can implement the agreement only through the enactment of legislation. If the trade agreement and the process of negotiating it meet certain requirements, TPA allows Congress to consider the required implementing bill under expedited procedures, pursuant to which the bill may come to the floor without action by the leadership, and can receive a guaranteed up-or-down vote with no amendments. Under TPA, an implementing bill may be eligible for expedited consideration if: (1) the trade agreement was negotiated during the limited time period for which TPA is in effect; (2) the agreement advances a series of U.S. trade negotiating objectives specified in the TPA statute; (3) the negotiations were conducted in conjunction with an extensive array of required notifications to and consultations with Congress and other stakeholders; and (4) the President submits to Congress a draft implementing bill, which must meet specific content requirements, and a range of required supporting information. If, in any given case, Congress judges that these requirements have not been met, TPA provides mechanisms through which the eligibility of the implementing bill for expedited consideration may be withdrawn in one or both chambers. TPA is authorized through July 1, 2021, if the President asks for an extension-as he did on March 20, 2018, and Congress does not enact an extension disapproval resolution within 60 days of July 1, 2018. The United States is now engaged in renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), for which TPA could be used to consider implementing legislation. The issue of TPA reauthorization raises a number of questions regarding TPA itself and the pending legislation. This chapter addresses a number of those questions that are frequently asked, including the following: • What is trade promotion authority? • Is TPA necessary? • What are trade negotiating objectives and how are they reflected in TPA statutes? • What requirements does Congress impose on the President under TPA? • Does TPA affect congressional authority on trade policy?. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

We investigated 6 of the 19 spin-offs from the 55 research centers at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in 1997. The Albuquerque area in Northern New Mexico is rich in technology, thanks to the presence of three large Federal R&D laboratories and the University of New Mexico. University administrators and community leaders envision a future technopolis (technology city), but achieving this goal will be difficult, given the lack of needed infrastructure, entrepreneurship, and venture capital in the Albuquerque region. Nevertheless, in the early 1990s the amount of research funding at UNM increased at a faster rate than at other U.S. research universities (total research funding rose to $197 million in 1996). Most of this increase (about 85%) took place through the efforts of UNM's 55 research centers, which are multidisciplinary units supported mainly by funding from federal and state government agencies, private companies, and foundations. The research centers transfer technological innovations across the university's boundary via various mechanisms, including spin-offs. A spin-off is a new company that is formed (1) by individuals who were former employees of the parent organization (a UNM research center in the present case), and (2) a core technology that is transferred from the parent organization. A previous study by the present authors identified 71 spin-offs from the three federal R&D laboratories in New Mexico. The fact that high-technology spin-offs are occurring in New Mexico, and at an increasing rate, suggests that a technopolis may be getting underway. In recent years the University of New Mexico and the federal R&D laboratories have established organizational and procedural mechanisms intended to encourage spin-offs and other types of technology transfer such as patenting and technology licensing. An important factor in the success of a spin-off company is the degree of support that it receives from its parent organization. The six UNM spin-offs of study here experienced few conflicts with their parent, in each case a university-based research center. However, lengthy negotiations with university officials over intellectual property rights to a spin-off's core technology were often involved. The director of a spin-off's parent research center usually played a key role in the spin-off process. Often the university research center continued to provide laboratory facilities and access to research equipment to the spin-off. Generally, both the spin-off and the parent organization perceived of the spin-off process as a win-win situation (which might not be the case when the parent is a private company and the spin-off becomes a competitor). In the present investigation we identify two types of spin-offs: (1) planned, when the new venture results from an organized effort by the parent organization, and (2) spontaneously occurring, when the new company is established by an entrepreneur who identifies a market opportunity and who founds the spin-off with little encouragement (and perhaps with discouragement) from the parent organization. Both types of spin-offs were represented in the present study. UNM professors, directors of the parent research centers, and others played important roles in instigating three of the six spin-offs, while the other three were launched mainly by entrepreneurs. Spin-offs represent an important mechanism for technology transfer, as a spin-off is typically founded around a core technological innovation that was initially developed at the parent organization. One reason that a research university is a vital ingredient in a technopolis is because of the considerable role that university-based research centers play in spinning-off new ventures. Stanford University in Silicon Valley, MIT on Route 128, and the University of Texas in Austin are all examples of this important relationship. The University of New Mexico is a smaller research university than Stanford, MIT, or Texas, but it is beginning to play a similar role in the spin-off process. If indeed a technopolis eventually develops in Albuquerque, perhaps in 10 or 20 years, lessons may be learned about the roles of a research university and its research centers (and federal R&D laboratories), in contributing to regional economic development. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.","","Article","Scopus"

This is mostly due to the reforms and transformations that Deng Xiaoping proclaimed. The change of sociopolitical and economic structures that had taken place laid the foundation for China's entry into world leaders in some positions. By the time Deng Xiaoping came to power, the Chinese economy was in decline after the ""political adventures"" of Mao Zedong. To get out of this situation, it was necessary to liberalize the economic and social sectors, as well as solve a whole range of foreign policy problems (from establishing official diplomatic relations with the USA and improving relations with the USSR, to solving the problems of Hong Kong and Macao) in order to become a harmonious part of the world community. To strengthen its position in the Asia-Pacific region, China needed, first of all, to establish relations with all its neighbours and resolve territorial disputes, of which there were many. This article is supposed to consider the question of the attempts of the PRC to resolve existing differences on the disputed parts of the borders with the Republic of India. In the period under review, China had several territorial disputes with its neighbours, which did not allow to realize the foreign policy potential, and there was also not a sufficient number of allies and economic partners of the PRC. As an example of a solution to border disputes, one can cite a positive result achieved in the course of negotiations with the USSR on the demarcation of the border. If China managed to achieve its goals with its northern neighbor, the question with India still remains open. In our study, an attempt will be made to analyse the course of the negotiation process between the PRC and the Republic of India in the last quarter of the 20th century and to identify the reasons for the lack of a decision on this issue. This analysis is interesting not only in terms of forecasting the development of the situation in the APR but also within the framework of other territorial problems of the PRC. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Aksai Chin; Arunachal Pradesh; China; Cold War; Dalai Lama; Deng Xiaoping; Foreign Policy; Indira Gandhi; Mao Zedong; Republic of India; Supply chain strategy; War; Zhou Enlai","Article","Scopus"

The company had recently been spun off from a much larger organization, and whereas it was still using the IT systems of the organization it had been part of, the license for those systems would soon expire. The IT vendor had been selected to build an entirely new enterprise information system. It was a big project so in order to circumscribe the observational work the fieldworkers focused on the team responsible for the sales subsystem. From the start there was trouble. The sales department of the manufacturing organization had dispatched a small group to work with the IT vendor to establish the requirements for the system and they insisted that the new system must support their current work flow, even though the software package their management had chosen in the early negotiations of the project was expressly designed for a different workflow. So the sales department's representatives made numerous requests to have the software package altered in fundamental ways. Furthermore, the sales subsystem team from the IT vendor was relatively inexperienced. Their leader had been selected because of his success in a previous project, but he was familiar neither with typical sales work processes nor with the software package.

There is an ever-growing body of scholarly research to assess and categorize differences in cross-national cultural values (e.g., Hofstede 1984; House et al. 2004) and social institutions (e.g., Hall and Soskice 2001; Busenitz, Gomez, and Spencer 2000) as they affect business practice and economic performance. Within this corpus of research, terms like liabilities of foreignness (Hymer 1976; Zaheer 1995), psychic distance (Johansson and Vahlne 1977), cultural distance (Kogut and Singh 1988), institutional distance (Xu and Shenkar 2002), and institutional idiosyncrasies (Henisz 2003) have become increasingly common. Although there is considerable variation in terms and rubrics, these studies typically draw out a general hypothesis that differences between cultures and social structures impede the success of cross-societal collaborative ventures. In the words of Javidan and House (2002), “From a practical point of view, the complexity of cross-national negotiations, mergers, assignments and leadership probably depends on the extent of the difference between the two cultures.” Despite widespread support for this premise, there has been relatively little empirical effort to examine the underlying processes – the actual dynamics and conditions – by which cross-societal variations in rules, norms, and cultural beliefs are translated into the kinds of complications and costs that have been documented by mainstream researchers (Shenkar 2001). To enhance understanding of how cross-societal friction actually arises, we analyzed a set of 23 case studies collected from cross-border contractors and investors, such as Bechtel, Walt Disney, and the World Bank, involved in large-scale global projects. © Cambridge University Press 2011.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

With the interchange of unilateral, bilateral, sub-regional, regional and global trade approaches, US trade strategists seek to maximize national interests by publicizing the positive effects of ""competitive liberalization"", scoring high with ""asymmetric reciprocity"", and rewarding the ""like-minded"" partner with strategic consideration. The effect of the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 granted the US President, and the consequential conclusions pursuant to FTAs were scrutinized - including US-Canada FTA, US-Mexico FTA, North American Free Trade Area, Free Trade Area of Americas, US-Singapore FTA, and Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative. The limitations of ""competitive liberalization"" are explored in terms of the reaction to the unilateral actions, the effect to global liberalization, and the nature of non-inclusiveness. Finally, the challenges ahead for the US will include the practice of hard-power unilateralism vis-à-vis soft power multilateralism, the FTAs as building blocks vis-à-vis stumbling blocks, the approach to negotiation as asymmetric bargain vis-à-vis consensual community building, and the sensitivity towards a mutually prosperous ""development"" round.","Competitive Liberalization; Doha Development Round; Free Trade Agreement (FTA); Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA); North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA); TPA (Trade Promotion Authority); World Trade Organization (WTO)","Review","Scopus"

Rational, self-interested neoclassical economic theories of human behavior predict tragedy in the absence of third party enforcement of agreements and practical difficulties that prevent privatization. Evolutionary biology offers a theory of cooperation, but more often than not in a context of discrimination against other groups. That is, in-group boundaries are necessarily defined by those excluded as members of out-groups. However, in some settings human’s exhibit behavior that is inconsistent with both rational economic and group driven cooperation of evolutionary biological theory. This paper reports the results of a non-cooperative game-theoretic exercise that models a tragedy of the commons problem in which groups of players may advance their own positions only at the expense of other groups. Students enrolled from multiple universities and assigned to different multi-university identity groups participated in experiments that repeatedly resulted in cooperative outcomes despite intergroup conflicts and expressions of group identity. We offer three possible explanations: (1) students were cooperative because they were in an academic setting; (2) students may have viewed their instructors as the out-group; or (3) the emergence of a small number of influential, ethical leaders is sufficient to ensure cooperation amongst the larger groups. From our data and analysis, we draw out lessons that may help to inform approaches for institutional design and policy negotiations, particularly in climate change management. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Collective action; Cooperation; Sustainability; Tragedy of the commons","Article","Scopus"

Prominent among these issues have been the recurring disputes between the United States and China over Chinese protection of foreign intellectual property. Since 1991 four bilateral agreements between China and the United States have addressed Chinese protection of intellectual property rights (IPRS). While the agreements were accompanied in the mid-1990s by US complaints over violations and subsequent bilateral tensions, the end of the millennium saw increased Chinese efforts to enforce foreign and domestic IPRS and less tension over the issue between the two governments. Our focus in this paper is on the economic and political foundations of the ongoing disputes between the two governments as well as the rapid convergence of Chinese IPR law and enforcement to OECD standards. International politics have clearly played an important role in the disputes. For example, the 1996 dispute over IPRs was, at least in part, a spillover from the wider sphere of US- China relations, in particular the contention over Taiwan policies and the 1996 visit of Taiwan's president to the United States. Domestic politics have played a role in the disputes, with the mid-1990s leadership transition in China (from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin) and the 1996 US presidential election increasing the need for politicians in both countries to become less flexible in their public stances, thereby further extending IPR negotiations and deepening tensions. Economic considerations have also played a fundamental role in these disputes. As a net exporter of intellectual property as well as IPR-intensive products, the United States has incentives to pressure China to upgrade IPR laws and enforcement, while China, a net importer of intellectual property and IPR- intensive goods, has incentives to resist. Relations between the two parties are tempered by the limited capacity of China's legal system and society to change rapidly in response to both domestic and foreign pressures. We argue that China's desire to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) fundamentally changed the nature of the game due to the WTO's strong minimum standards for IPR laws and the veto held by the United States and the European Union over Chinese ascension to WTO membership.","","Article","Scopus"

Three levels of integration of component analyses are defined. The weakest is associated with multidisciplinary research in which components stand on their own. Integration here involves editorial organization, consistent terminology, and concordant concepts. The strongest level involves a shared, over-arching theoretical framework which welds components into a unit. Most interdisciplinary research can realistically aspire only to an intermediate level of integration wherein disciplinary components serve as substantive inputs to each other. Attainment of well-integrated interdisciplinary research is a complex task. This study identifies four frameworks useful in integration based on a probe of 24 technology assessments. Common group learning generates a common intellectual property belonging to the research group. It yields well-integrated research, but often at the cost of a loss of depth of analysis. Formal modeling can structure interrelationships, and, thereby, serve as an integrating framework. Modeling is most applicable to well-specified problems, but it can contribute, in conjunction with other frameworks, to broader, policy-oriented studies as well. Negotiation among experts takes place at the common boundaries between component analyses as these substantively affect each other's findings. It preserves the full depth of expertise and can be used in broad-ranging studies. Integration by the project leader establishes one person as the sole repository of composite knowledge, obtained through one-to-one interactions with assorted experts. It is not well-suited to interdisciplinary research, except in small-scale studies. © 1979.","","Article","Scopus"

The conference was sponsored by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, the Saltman Center for Conflict Resolution of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the United States Institute of Peace. This interdisciplinary conference's six panels, whose proceedings are summarized in the series of articles that follow, explored the religious, ideological, psychological, political, legal, and international dimensions of the conflict. Presenters included former and current Israeli and American government officials, experts on resettlement policies and compensation mechanisms, and scholars from a variety of disciplines. While presentation topics covered a range of issues relating to the settlements, three broad themes arose from the conference.First, participants agreed that it is important, if not fundamental, to understand the perspectives of the national religious settlers who are the driving force behind the settlement movement. Exploring the settlers' diverse interests, fears, and identities is necessary in order to see why relocation is so threatening to them. The Israeli government can lessen opposition to withdrawal by showing the settlers empathy and reassurance, but only if government officials first achieve a true understanding of the settlers' concerns. Participants also argued that a reframing of the relocation in ideological terms could be another critical component of a solution to this problem. It may be necessary for the leaders of the settlement movement to develop a new narrative or modify the existing one in order to legitimize their relocation. Part of this narrative will involve the concept of ""a greater good"" - the government must reassure the settlers that their sacrifice is for a higher cause. Several participants noted that Israel needs to show the settlers ""tough love."" When the relocations begin, many expect that there will be violence and that disturbing images will be broadcast throughout Israel and around the world. Internal disruption could put the government led by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Likud party coalition in jeopardy. The government must not waver in the face of this crisis, conference participants argued. In fact, the threat of violent and disruptive resistance by settlers and their allies can be part of the solution, not just the problem. The government and relocation supporters can use this extremism to justify decisive measures and to redefine the problem for the broader population to convince them that the stability of the country is at stake. Another major conclusion of conference participants was that, while the Israeli settlement issue has unique features, there is much to be learned from comparative analysis. Other countries have dealt with settlement situations, and their experiences offer invaluable lessons. In particular, participants contrasted Israel's settlements in Gaza and the West Bank with French settlements in Algeria and English settlements in Ireland. Some pointed to the French withdrawal from Algeria, which was politically painful but ultimately successful, as an example of ""tough love"" that Israel should follow. Finally, the involvement of third parties to help solve this conflict is indispensable. Participants noted that while much of Israel feels alienated from the European Union and the United Nations, the Israeli government is highly sensitive to the concerns of the United States, as evidenced by Sharon's decision to show the Gaza withdrawal plan to the U.S. government before he had even raised it with his cabinet and the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. International participation could help legitimize withdrawal and reduce Israeli responsibility for Gaza's future. Third parties can apply political pressure to encourage an accountable and responsible Palestinian leadership. They may also be called upon to provide some sort of financial aid. The participants acknowledged the complexity of the settlement problem and recognized that easy solutions do not exist. Yet, if the Israeli government works toward understanding the settlers' perspectives, learns from comparative analysis, and involves third parties appropriately, the likelihood of a successful outcome increases greatly. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing.","","Article","Scopus"

As the field has grown and gained traction, it has increasingly received attention from professional associations and industry leaders in the world of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). More recently, it has begun to receive recognition from sources outside of this field — in both the public and private sectors. As the field develops and individual initiatives become widely adopted, the attention it receives from external sources will undoubtedly focus on questions of quality, ethics, practitioner training, service provider qualifications, and monitoring. These questions — already beginning to be heard from within the field — derive, in essence, from one shared overall question, that of appropriate governance for the ODR field. In this article, we will explain what we mean when we discuss a field's governance and suggest that the field itself should investigate issues of its own governance. We explore and explain the current “low-to-no” state of governance in ODR — and the developments that are likely, should the field fail to actively address this issue. We discuss the costs of no governance, and the potential costs and disadvantages of employing a higher-governance model. We ask whether ODR can, indeed, be governed at all, and illustrate why addressing ODR governance is a very complex venture, in terms of the web of factors to be addressed, no matter how beneficial internal governance may be. We do not, in this article, intend to decide any of these questions — but, rather, to pose them to the ODR field and to the wider fields of ADR and conflict management. We point out why the ODR field is at a developmental point that is highly suitable for discussing and deciding these questions — and why these decisions might have far-reaching implications for a wide range of conflict-related fields. © 2016 President and Fellows of Harvard College","alternative dispute resolution; ethics; governance; mediation; negotiation; online dispute resolution; technology","Article","Scopus"

Their influence, though, extends far beyond the corporate sphere and they play an important part in public administration and in particular in its dialog with society at large. Here, from the viewpoint of historical institutionalism, we document one of the earliest successful examples of the wider application of management science: the 1914 antitrust rules (the Clayton Antitrust and Federal Trade Commission Acts) from the perspectives of economic scholars as technical experts, the early years of the Wilson administration, and the spheres of business and society. The societal debate about business and efficiency and the successive implementation of scientific managerial ideas in the administrative sphere, saw management science permeate the whole of American society and become an almost irrefutable aspect of everyday life and representations, thereby enabling it to spread well beyond the boundaries of the firm. Evidence for Practice From a Science, Technology and Society (STS) perspective, managerial thinking extends far beyond technical debates or shared practices. Efficiency plays a dual role as a value and as a criterion of the optimal use of resources, which should be incorporated into public policy design with respect to business regulation. Negotiation between public administration and social actors is multidimensional and requires identifiable and accountable leaders.

The backdrop is the recent increases in OFDI from emerging economies and the emergence of several emerging economy firms, which have caught up to become global leaders in several industries. The paper focuses particularly on experiences from Asian economies. Design/methodology/approach – The paper applies a multi method approach and relies on literature studies, investment statistics, government reports, press reports, company reports, and interviews with public officials. Findings – Extending the motivebased business theory, the paper first establishes the pronouncement of a third wave of OFDI from the mid1990s. Whereas the typical motives have remained important, the technologyseeking motive has become significantly more important during the third wave. Typical policy prescriptions to liberalize government regulations have been called into question. Many home emerging country governments have acted to coordinate their activities by regulating proactively investment outflows. The evidence also shows that the successful investment outflows have benefited significantly from home governments addressing the characteristics and motives of target industries and locations abroad. Practical implications – The analysis shows that contrary to mainstream prescriptions many home governments have successfully regulated strongly OFDI from the emerging economies. However, it is important for home governments to consider the broader interest of promoting capital flows to ensure the longterm development of economies rather than narrow national interests. Home and host governments should seek to establish common and specific collaboration platforms to raise information flows and coordinate better the negotiations and execution of investment projects. Originality/value – The paper provides a more thorough analysis of the implications for home country policies of the increasing outward investment flows from emerging economies and the increasing competitiveness and capabilities of their transnational firms. It proposes augmentations to prior frameworks of drivers and motives of OFDI and pushes deeper the home policy implications of increasing outward investment flows. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Emerging markets; Government policy; International investments; South Asia; South East Asia","Article","Scopus"

The first company, United Airlines (UAL), awash in debt, filed for bankruptcy in 2002. Until its bankruptcy filing, UAL had hoped for government loan guarantees to bail it out. When these guarantees failed to materialize, UAL was left owning a fleet of planes twice the size it needed, (Cite: Dis-united) paying wages pursuant to an uncompetitive union wage structure, and experiencing shrinking revenues due in part to lower air travel post 9/11. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and emerged as a new company in 2006. General Motors (GM), the second company, also faced the possibility of bankruptcy in 2008. At that time, it operated a number of manufacturing plants manned by unionized American employees who earned tens of dollars per hour more than GM's international competitors. This considerable wage/benefit cost disadvantage coupled with a shrinking revenue base, aging manufacturing capacity, more dealers than it needed, and rising debt levels pushed GM towards bankruptcy. At the end of 2008, GM too awaited a government bailout. This case looks at financial and operating restructuring opportunities available to a company through bankruptcy. First, the case looks at interest savings achieved by UAL after emerging from bankruptcy. The case posits the question, are these savings (attributed to UAL's lower levels of debt), available to GM if it filed for bankruptcy protection? This case also looks at the operating cost savings demonstrated by UAL following emergence from bankruptcy. Although in a different industry, the case leads students through calculations of operating cost savings potentially available to GM through bankruptcy. These include costs such as wages, benefits, and supplier costs (if GM follows the UAL model). Finally, the case looks at issues pertaining to organized labor and, in particular, legacy costs. These costs are credited with handicapping and diminishing the competitiveness of both American auto manufacturers and older airlines worldwide. ""Legacy costs"" is the term used for worker pensions and health care benefits that were negotiated in past collective bargaining agreements and incurred by the organization under different leadership or when the organization's priorities and resources were different (Cooney, 2002, 2005). Because of benefits established and enhanced through several decades of collective bargaining, the automobile industry finds itself supporting a large number of retirees and health care beneficiaries (Cooney, 2002, 2005). Along with legacy costs, American autoworkers remain among the highest paid manufacturing workers in the world; sometimes paid when they do not work via the ""jobs bank"". The ""jobs bank"" is a program which gives American automobile union workers most of their pay and benefits while they are laid off, eliminating the need for such employees to seek unemployment benefits (Langlois, 2009). Another potential source of financial woe for the American auto industry is executive compensation. Rick Wagoner, CEO for GM, is paid a yearly compensation totaling around 14.4 million (Farago, 2008, Forbes, 2009). Many hate to see a wealthy CEO making millions of dollars with a golden parachute for running a company that might ultimately declare bankruptcy. Therefore, this case addresses the implications of managerial decision-making especially negotiations with union representatives' demands and/or concessions that are potentially needed to ultimately keep the American automobile industry solvent and competitive. The case has a difficulty level of 4-5 and is recommended for college seniors and first year MBA students. With three major categories of issues covered (interest savings achievable through bankruptcy, operating cost savings achievable through bankruptcy, and issues related to bankruptcy and labor unions), it is expected the case will take three hours of class time. Students aware of current business events (such as the potential government bailout of GM) will require little or no outside preparation. Students who are unaware of the potential GM government bailout will need to review current business periodical articles on General Motors. Total outside of class preparation should not exceed one hour. (Note: Whenever possible, company financial data was taken directly from company published financial reports. When amounts were not specifically disclosed, estimates were used, based upon actual disclosed data.) Case Synopsis: It is early 2008. The GM board of directors is meeting to discuss 2007 financial results. The results are not good. The company is preparing to announce that it just lost $38 billion and is $184 billion in debt. You, as a board member, have heard management's explanations of the losses for sometime now. You know that GM has too many manufacturing facilities, but union contracts prevent it from shutting them down. You know the average hourly wage/benefit package of a GM factory worker is $30 per hour higher than its non-union competition. However, union contracts bar it from cutting employee and retiree medical/pension costs that cause the cost differential. Management has some good news. Sales are up and cost control efforts are starting to pay off. Some of the unprofitable GM dealerships are closing which is good news as you have too many dealers. However, the company is running out of cash. Management reports that under current conditions, it may have enough cash through 2009. However, if a recession occurs, it may be out of cash in 2008. Discussion turns to government bailouts. Board members bristle at government intervention when discussion focuses on the strings which may be attached. Finally, a board member mentions the ""B"" word, and suggests filing bankruptcy and getting a fresh start. (Several airlines have done it and are up, operating, and profitable.) Members squirm in their chairs as a different board member discusses her experience with another bankrupt company. You are uneasy and ask management to investigate GM's options. This case leads students through a three pronged approach of applying the airline bankruptcy model to GM. Questions focus students on bankruptcy's potential impacts on debt and interest, operating costs, and labor unions.

With the global economy undergoing deep structural changes, the negotiations between Canada and the EU on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) present a real-time experiment that sheds light on the direction that the relationships between two economic units of the G8 will take. For Canada, an agreement with the EU would end its current dependency on the US; for the EU, an agreement with Canada would be a first with a G8-economy and indicate how its new trade strategy 'Global Europe' will look like. This book is the first to simultaneously analyze the undercurrents of this project and introduce the main topics at hand. CETA is much more than a simple free trade agreement, its breadth covers regulatory aspects in goods, services, and finance; the opening of public procurement markets; attitudes and policies of Canadian provinces towards liberalization; climate policies and international leadership claims of the EU in comparison to Canadian policy attempts; the challenges of the Euro project and the reform efforts; and the challenges of the Euro as a international reserve currency. CETA is a challenging project that will kick-start enormous changes in trade policy-making as well as in market openness in Canada. It will mark the EU's efforts to re-make the Atlantic Economy. This book provides deep insights into the ambiguity of the project and addresses the implications of a rapidly changing global economy for trade policy. Offering analysis of the financial industry, banking, trade policy, climate change strategy, and the Euro exchange rate, this book should be of interest to students and policy-makers alike. © 2011 selection and editorial matter; Kurt Hübner, individual chapters; the contributors.

Design/methodology/approach: This is self-reflective and action-oriented research on the affordances and constraints of two-mode virtual collaboration. In the spirit of professional development, the authors (nine researchers at different career stages and from various counties) engaged in a joint endeavour to evaluate the affordances and constraints of virtual collaborations in light of the recent literature while also researching the authors' own virtual collaboration during this evaluative task (mid-January–April 2021). The authors used two modes: synchronous (Zoom) and asynchronous (emails) to communicate on the literature exploration and recorded reactions and emotional responses towards existing affordances and constraints through a collective journal. Findings: The results suggest both affordances in terms of communication being negotiable and evolving and constraints, particularly in forming new relations given tools that may not be equally accessible to all. Journaling during collaborations could be a valuable tool, especially for virtual collective work, because it can be used to structure the team supported negotiation and discussion processes, especially often hidden processes. It is evident that the role of a leader can contribute to an alignment in the assumptions and experiences of trust and consequently foster greater mutual understanding of the circumstances for productive team collaborations. Originality/value: The findings of this study can inform academics and practitioners on how to create and facilitate better opportunities for collaboration in virtual teams as a rapidly emerging form of technology-supported working. © 2022, Irina A.

Culture beats, eats or trumps strategy is a legitimate and powerful argument often thrown to the air. The purpose of this paper is to un-code the relevance of this argument and to decode its significance. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper and builds on prior conceptual and empirical management research related to strategy and organizational culture. The approach is unbiased toward either strategy or culture. Findings: The conclusion arrived at is that, in general, strategy must precede culture and culture must be aligned. In specific instances of governance, inner workings of a military organization, cross-cultural context of negotiations, creative advertising and management of change culture may predominate in tactics. Furthermore, with a strategy gone astray, or in the instance of a floundering business or start-up venture, culture must shift to first gear, lead the requisite goal and path development, and strategy must be aligned in the transition. A strategy–culture fit supports a sustained competitive advantage by virtue of a firm’s unique culture proposition (UCP). Research limitations/implications: The development of a culture-centric SBM will need to be tested by empirical research. The UCP will also need to be researched further. Practical implications: The conclusion that strategy should generally precede culture will guide firms from not letting their organizational culture from undermining the success of major shifts in strategic goals and business model positioning. Originality/value: The conceptual arguments will help leaders and managers from marginalizing the value of strategy. However, managers will also be directed toward paying attention to the damaging consequences of ignoring culture. Furthermore, managers will be able to appreciate that culture must not drive strategy, except in specific strategic decision-making contexts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Culture strategy alignment; Strategy","Article","Scopus"

Before the dispute, the EC was the world’s largest sugar exporter, even with extremely high production costs. Brazil, Australia, and Thailand were more competitive sugar producers, but their sugar exports were unfairly displaced in third markets by cheap-subsidized EU sugar. The international trade of sugar used to be one of the most protected in the world. Brazil, a low-cost producer and competitive exporter of agricultural goods, faced multiple tariff and nontariff barriers to export the commodity, especially, from the European Union. The EU built its sugar subsidies regime in the late 1960s, combining several tools to support the production and export of sugar, such as high tariffs, a price support system, and export subsidies. To try to erode this protectionist framework, the Brazilian government and the sugar industry decided to take the issue to the dispute settlement mechanism of the Word Trade Organization (WTO). The outcome of this WTO dispute made international sugar trade more equitable and based on competitive advantage. Along with the cotton case, the results of the sugar dispute also advanced Brazil’s leadership at the WTO Doha Round negotiations, especially regarding agricultural subsidies. By revamping the agricultural subsidy policies of the two major superpowers through a legal—and legitimate—tool, Brazil also gained support from NGOs and the general public, drawing attention to the importance of nonsubsidized agricultural trade to promote the well-being of farmers, rural cities, and workers in developing countries. Although it could be argued that the Doha Round is now dead, the Nairobi decision to prohibit export subsidies of agricultural products could be also traced back to the sugar dispute learning curve experience. Unlike the cotton litigation, which lasted longer, the dispute over the European sugar subsidies is a salutary example of rapid use of the multilateral dispute settlement system with effective implementation of the recommendations. Today, the EC imports an average of 3.25 million tons of sugar per year, and the complainant countries had significantly increased their world exports in both volume and value. In addition to building a strong legal case, the team of diplomats, lawyers, and private sector representatives involved in the construction of the dispute also had to work on a strong enlightenment campaign with the media, civil society (NGOs), and representatives of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, with preferential access to the European market. It was a victory won inside and outside the WTO DSB with a strong partnership between the government and the private sector. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

It contributes to a greater understanding of how Muslims living as a minority in Australia and the UK negotiate Islamic doctrine in secular societies by focusing on one aspect of this negotiation, namely the prohibition of ribā. There is little debate in the Islamic tradition on the prohibition of ribā. The differences, however, lie in the interpretation of ribā and the question of how Muslims live in a society that is heavily reliant on interest and conventional banking, yet at the same time adhere to Islamic guidelines. Through the words of religious leaders, Muslim professionals and university students, Imran Lum provides real accounts of how Muslims in Australia and the UK practically deal with conventional banking and finance products such as home loans, savings accounts and credit cards. He also explores Muslim attitudes towards Islamic finance and queries whether religion is the sole determining factor when it comes to its uptake. Drawing on his own unique experience as a practitioner responsible for growing an Islamic business in a conventional bank, Lum provides a firsthand account of the complexities associated with structuring Islamic finance products that are not only sharia compliant but also competitive in a non-Muslim jurisdiction. Using ṣukūk bonds as a case study, he highlights the tangible and non-tangible barriers to product development, such as tax and regulatory requirements and the rise of Islamophobia. Combining academic and industry experience, Lum unpacks the relationship of Islamic finance with Muslim identity construction in the West and how certain modalities of religiosity can lead to an uptake of Islamic finance, while others can lead to its rejection. © 2022 Imran Lum.","","Book","Scopus"

Previously published works of authors dedicated to the construction of a mathematical model of time to build a consensus (number of negotiations) in terms of variation in the number of TC members and their level of authoritarianism. The present study is a continuation of these works for the case of the formation of coalitions in TC. The mathematical model is constructed to ensure con-sensus on the work of technical standardization committees in terms of coalitions, which are overcome during the nego-tiation process by concessions. This paper analyzes the factors, which influence the time for consensus building in this case: the value of the assignment and an index of the effect of the coalition. It is proved that the time to build a consensus significantly depends on the value of unilateral concessions coalition and weakly depends on the size of coalitions with a fixed number of TC members. Built regression model of dependence of the average number of approvals from the value of the assignment. It was revealed that even a small concession leads to the onset of consensus, increasing the size of the assignment results (with other factors being equal) to a sharp decline in time before the consensus. It is shown that the assignment of a larger coalition against small coalitions takes on average more time before building a consensus. The factors influencing the variability of the number of concessions were investigated. The change in the root-mean-square deviation (RMS) of the time to build a consensus varies nonlinearly from small concessions Y=10% to large Y=75%, regardless of the ratio of the number of members between coalitions. In the simulations, at concessions Y=10% there is the largest variation among the number of consensuses in the experiments. Concession of the authoritarian leader in group reduces the number of negotiations and increases the quality of consensus. The results obtained are of practical value for all structures where the emergence of coalitions entails the impossibility of consensual decision-making and requires consideration of different ways to build a consensual solution. © Original content of this work is copyright © International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.

One path for employees to secure flexible work is through the negotiation of individualized work arrangements, also known as “i-deals”. This study provides valuable insights into the nomological network of schedule-flexibility i-deals by drawing on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory. We propose that, via resource accumulation, schedule-flexibility i-deals are a mechanism through which the emotional support of supervisors promotes employees' family performance and reduces deviant work behaviors. Drawing further on the COR framework, we examine two boundary conditions that guide employees' resource investment: perception of family-friendly environment and prosocial motivation. We collected multi-source data from employees working in South America and tested our hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Our results provide support for the key mediating role of schedule-flexibility i-deals. Moreover, the indirect relationship between supervisors' emotional support and family performance through schedule-flexibility i-deals is stronger in family-friendly organizational contexts, as well as when employees are prosocially motivated. Our results also show that, contrary to the expected effect, when prosocial motivation is high, employee supervisors' emotional support is positively linked to deviant behaviors. We contribute to the literature by emphasizing the roles of perceived resources at the levels of leaders (i.e., supervisors' emotional support), context (supervisors' perceptions of a family-friendly environment), and individuals (employees' prosocial motivation). We demonstrate the importance of these resources in establishing and sustaining schedule-flexibility i-deals. © 2019","Deviant behavior; Family performance; Prosocial motivation; Schedule-flexibility i-deals; Supervisor emotional support","Article","Scopus"

When it comes to the legitimacy of norms to address the complexities of social conditions of vulnerability and effective actions to fulfil distributive and climate justice principles, climate change still faces a discrepancy between political announcements and incongruous practices of international actors. While analysing the cases of China and the European Union, we point out contradictions stemming from their policy goals guided by strategic interests. From a global climate justice perspective, we analyze recent power dynamics that operate at two levels: first, economic relations and negotiations between Brazil and the two poles of power, considering the scenario of socio-environmental injustice and climate insecurity; second, policy practices of both global players in climate governance, bearing in mind the notions of climate justice and development as conceptual guides to understand when and where contradictions emerge. To do so, this article is structured around three sections: (i) a brief historical account of China’s and the EU’s roles in international climate policy; (ii) their legacies in climate governance and the inextricable relationship between their normative behaviour and their development objectives; (iii) an overview of the signing of the strategic memorandum of understanding for economic and trade agreement between Mercosur and the EU in 2019, as well as Sino-Brazilian relations facilitating investments and trade in multiple segments vis-à-vis the most recent multifaceted backlash in Brazil’s socio-environmental and climate policies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Article","Scopus"

It focuses on the impact of three key dimensions of the SDMP, namely, rationality, intuition and political behaviour, relating to four changes introduced, namely, acquisitions, branch network rationalisation, integration of information technology (IT) and downsizing of operations and personnel. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted, targeting Greek banks' top management. Out of 140 questionnaires, 78 were returned, a 55.71% response rate. Data was analysed using structural equation modelling. Research findings identify rationality as a key dimension of SDMP for all organisational changes, as there was high focus on identifying and analysing all required information, use of external financial advisors, and reliance on multiple methods of information gathering. Decision-makers used their intuition in the form of past experience when making acquisition decisions, whilst their personal judgment and ""inner voice"" were neglected. Finally, political behaviour was not displayed during this process, as decision-makers were open with each other about their interests and preferences, and there was no bargaining, negotiation or use of power amongst them. One limitation was that of not considering all the factors that might help measure SDMP characteristics. Also, this study was conducted in a period of political and financial uncertainty for Greek banks, as well as for the Greek economy in general, so findings may not be generalizable to other industries and countries. Conducting interviews could have offered deeper insight as well. This study's value lies in the fact that the organisational changes were determined by Greece's leaders, and thus the Greek banks had to operate under a dynamic, inflexible and non-autonomous environment. Also, this study extends prior SDMP research by examining the impact of the three key SDMP dimensions on four types of organisational change. © 2018, Academy of Business and Retail Management Research.","Acquisitions; Intuition; Organisational change; Political behaviour; Rationality; Strategic decision-making process (SDMP)","Article","Scopus"

On October 27 1997, the turmoil in Asian markets spooked Wall Street in the largest single-day decline in history, a drop of 550 points. It was predicted that the Asian crash could drive the US trade deficit from $191 billion to $300 billion by 1998, creating huge new tensions in relations with some of the largest US trading partners. These wrenching changes, following a generation of success, raise numerous questions about the steps that led to the crisis, its likely outcome and the limits and constraints of ""Asian capitalism"". Edith Terry presents a blow-by-blow account of the crisis, beginning with the 1996 collapse of the Bangkok Bank of Commerce. In her overview, she links the fall of the Asian miracle with the theme of globalization, arguing that the crisis demonstrates the urgency of dismantling restraints to trade, investment, and financial services, and that the United States should take leadership in pushing for new and sweeping reform through the World Trade Organization and in bilateral negotiations with its trading partners.

International air and marine travel have been left to one side in past talks because the pursuit of agreement proceeds on the basis of commitment by sovereign nations and the effects of these specific commercial activities are, by their nature, difficult to corral and assign to specific national jurisdictions. However, air travel is increasing and, unless something is done, emissions from this segment of our world economy will form a progressively larger percentage of the total, especially as emissions fall in other activities. This book focuses on fuel. The aim is to provide background in technical and policy terms, from the broadest reliable sources of information available, for the necessary discourse on society's reaction to the evolving aviation emissions profile. It considers what policy has been, why and how commercial air travel is committed to its current liquid fuel, how that fuel can be made without using fossil-source materials, and the barriers to change. It also advances some elements of policy remedies that make sense in providing an environmentally and economically sound way forward in a context that comprehends a more complete vision of sustainability than 'renewable fuels' traditionally have.

By way of conclusion we recall the main findings and recommendations for the developing countries and identify the topics currently under discussion regarding countrie's technical and innovation capabilities in relation to sustainable economic growth and well-being and the links between forms of protection of intellectual property and the promotion of innovation. Since the late 1980s, the Latin American countries in general and the smallest ones in particular have sought actively to enter the world economy's main tendencies by opening up their economies, looking for new trading partners, and attracting foreign direct investment. The rates and strategies for entry are diverse, but the first step taken by all the countries was unilateral trade liberalization based on tariff-reduction programs. The second step was participation in the multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round and accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The third step was the negotiation and signing of bilateral and regional trade agreements (Martínez-Piva and Padilla, 2007). All of this has resulted in a new development model whose strategy is to attract foreign investment helping to complement investment needs, so that external markets boost growth through the demand for domestic products and so that the supply of new products stimulates production and technology transfer. The signing of free trade agreements with the United States is a natural step of the trade policy adopted by various countries of Latin America, among them those of Central America, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic Mexico, Panama, and Peru. These countries assign a central role to foreign investment and international trade in their development model, in which the United States is a very significant trading partner and an important source of foreign investment. Prior to the signing of the free trade agreements, a large part of the Central American and Andean exports to the United States benefited from diverse preferential-treatment schemes whose unilateral nature gave rise to uncertainty as to their renewal (Pacheco and Valerio, 2007). These and other considerations led to the negotiation and signing of free trade agreements that eliminate the uncertainty, but include strict intellectual property rules Despite the dynamic growth of exports in some of the countries of Latin America and their diversification toward manufactures - especially Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico - including those of high and medium technology, the value added of exports continues to be low on account of their considerable dependence on imported intermediate inputs. Thus, the growth of exports has been accompanied by an increase in imports, particularly in technology-based industries such as electronics, whose inputs are largely imported. This gap highlights the need to create productive links between the manufacturing export industry and the rest of the local economy (Martínez-Piva and Padilla, 2007). The current productive specialization of most of the Latin American countries, like the majority of the developing countries, concentrates on links in the global value chain that are less knowledge intensive, such as assembly and large-scale manufacture. This type of integration, characterized by the temporary importation of intermediate goods for their subsequent exportation, is limited as regards the development of technological capabilities. This means that in order to raise productivity, improve worker's income and achieve dynamic competitiveness, it is necessary to have public policies that promote escalation on the production value chain. In their contribution, Cimoli and Primi show a parallel between ""North-South"" asymmetry in patenting activities and technological capabilities, and the ""North- South"" asymmetry in technological intensity of production structures and patterns of specialization. Although patenting is not the only indicator of countrie's technological capability, its dynamics reflects the structural differences between them. The industrialized countries have production structures that are more specialized in activities and sectors that are knowledge and technology intensive, and invest more resources in research and development, so it is not surprising that they are leaders in the number, diversity, and rate of patents applied for and granted. If the technological capabilities of the developing countries determine their condition on the periphery, their transition toward a position of leadership in the international market makes it necessary to emphasize the policies on diffusion and access to knowledge, innovation, and creation of technology. Trade policies and policies to reinforce intellectual property rights do not in themselves make it possible to move toward economies capable of escalating on the national production value chain. Free trade has favored a dynamic rate of technological change in the developing countries, but it is furthered by imports of capital goods with different degrees of technological intensity. This has determined that most of the advanced national companies undertake little research in the conventional sense, although they take pains to imitate and develop adaptive and incremental innovations. In view of their dependence on imports of capital goods with incorporated technology and their lack of significant advanced scientific and technological infrastructure, it will be difficult for developing countries to take the path of innovation without previously implementing the appropriate policies. Mexico signed the North American Free Trade Agreement and created the Mexican Industrial Property Institute in 1993. This Institute has made important efforts to promote patenting and the use of its stock of information to strengthen innovation in that country. Paradoxically, the register of Mexican patents dropped 12%, whereas that of foreign patents doubled between 1995 and 2005, even though spending on scientific and technological activities also doubled during the period. Spending on research and development in Mexico rose from 0.2 to 0.4% as a percentage of GDP, but it continues to be very low in comparison with the United States, which invests almost 2.69% of GDP under this heading. The coefficient of investment in science and technology in Mexico is five times lower than the OECD average. The rest of Latin America is not doing much better. The countries that invest the most in research and development fail to reach 1% of GDP: Brazil (0.99%) and Chile (0.57%). The region as a whole registers an average level of around 0.5% of GDP, which definitely does not contribute to reducing the technological gap with the developed countries: in the United States, for instance, this indicator has remained at around 2.5% of GDP for several years (Lugones, 2007).","","Book chapter","Scopus"

International air and marine travel have been left to one side in past talks because the pursuit of agreement proceeds on the basis of commitment by sovereign nations and the effects of these specific commercial activities are, by their nature, difficult to corral and assign to specific national jurisdictions. However, air travel is increasing and, unless something is done, emissions from this segment of our world economy will form a progressively larger percentage of the total, especially as emissions fall in other activities. This book focuses on fuel. The aim is to provide background in technical and policy terms, from the broadest reliable sources of information available, for the necessary discourse on society's reaction to the evolving aviation emissions profile. It considers what policy has been, why and how commercial air travel is committed to its current liquid fuel, how that fuel can be made without using fossil-source materials, and the barriers to change. It also advances some elements of policy remedies that make sense in providing an environmentally and economically sound way forward in a context that comprehends a more complete vision of sustainability than 'renewable fuels' traditionally have. The goal of Will Sustainability Fly? is to broaden and contextualize the knowledge resource available to academics, policy makers, air industry leaders and stakeholders, and interested members of the public. © 2015 Walter J.

Although the industrial nations of the north have the financial and technological resources to begin addressing the problem, they ultimately remain vulnerable to the actions of the developing nations of the south. The negotiation process now a decade old - has, thus far, failed to produce a universal agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. This failure is attributed to the lack of a unifying principle capable of overcoming the short-term differences in interest among the two groups of countries. Science and politics, the two forces driving the GCC debate, have inherent weaknesses that prevent them from providing the leadership necessary to secure universal cooperation in combating this major threat to the global environment. Ethics, specifically the principles of equity and justice, is proposed as a possible unifying principle. An analysis of the four main issues that must be resolved before a universal agreement to combat GCC can be negotiated - the appropriate level for GHGs, the proper distribution of GHG emission rights, the best actions for attaining the appropriate GHG level, and the form of the institutional arrangements that will be necessary to carry out these actions - indicates that ethical considerations can and must inform and delineate appropriate bounds for science, economics, and politics. Guaranteeing the equitable and just distribution of rights and responsibilities in a global climate change regime offers the best prospect for such a regime to be made possible.","Equity; Ethics; Global climate change; Policy; Politics","Article","Scopus"

The case has a difficulty level of three and is therefore appropriate for seniors or graduate students. The case was crafted with courses in organizational development, human resource management, and leadership in mind, but given the pervasive need to manage conflicts this case is appropriate for a broad range of courses. The case is designed to be taught during one 75 minute class and we expect students will need at least three hours of preparation time outside of the classroom. An optional one 75 minute class time extension of the case introduces the student to why at times seemingly ethical people do unethical things drawing from the Stanford Prison and the Milligan Experiments. An optional alternative involves conflict resolution games designed to help students fully embrace the art and science of negotiations and mediation. This case is framed around the personal experience of a faculty member whose dispute with supervisors lead to the resignation of a chair, the eventual firing of a dean, and the loss of good will with key community stakeholders. It focuses on the analysis of an internal grievance process that brings the student to two decision points, namely, 1) what shortcomings exist in the current internal grievance process and 2) what changes should be made to make them more fair and effective? The case briefly addresses and illustrates the foundational skills of dispute resolution and mediation designed to resolve conflicts efficiently and fairly at the lowest cost.","","Article","Scopus"

The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to study guanxi and business ethics in China within the context of social capital development, with a view to creating a more balanced interpretation that provides insights for Westerners wishing to conduct business in China. Design/methodology/approach In terms of methodology, the work is based on the results of a recent survey conducted among Chinese executives in southern China. Findings The major findings suggest that the processes of developing social capital and the nurturing of company-to-company relationships need to be planned carefully. Thus, no one individual should be responsible for the China connection, although the appointment of a team leader is essential, otherwise the Chinese side would become confused. Negotiations always are to be conducted on a team basis and always approved at the highest levels in the corporate structure. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this paper include the difficulties of obtaining any research sample in China. Thus, we refer to the work of Weiss, (Learning From Strangers, Free Press, New York.) and use a snowball sample. Originality/value The practical implications of the paper are that guanxi (a type of social capital), can be managed and that corruption does not have to result from the use of guanxi-based relationships. Thus, the originality arises out of the practical implications, in that for the first time, Western concepts of social capital and Asian concepts of guanxi have been compared, leading to practical recommendations for Western managers. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Asia; Business ethics; Social capital; Social networks","Article","Scopus"

In response to these pleas, recent studies have addressed union activists’perceptions of their unions’roles in negotiating quality of worklife as well as other issues. Although important, these studies have focused on the union leadership and have generally failed to consider the rank and file union members' views. The primary objective of the present study was to examine union members’preferred roles of their union in negotiating quality of worklife, productivity, and traditional bargaining issues. A second purpose was to explore the correlates of their views concerning the union's role in dealing with these issues. Using data collected from 171 members of a railroad, union, the results showed that members’ support for union involvement tended to vary depending upon the type of issue in question. They strongly preferred collective bargaining when dealing with traditional union concerns and joint union‐management efforts when quality of worklife issues were involved. In predicting preferred union‐management cooperation, the importance of the individual predictors varied across the types of negotiation issues. However, attitudinal measures were generally found to be more important in explaining members’preferences than demographic or union participation measures. The results are discussed in terms of implications for implementing joint union‐management programs. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","","Article","Scopus"

Meanwhile, the demand for new, effective medical and drug treatments continues to rise as unhealthy lifestyles cause further increases in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Global drug pricing is one of the most hotly debated yet least understood aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. How should drug prices be set and what does it mean for patients? Why do governments increasingly get involved, and what is its impact on the global competitive environment? How can a life-saving industry have a poorer image than gun and tobacco industries, whose products are associated with death? Ed Schoonveld explains how pharmaceutical prices are determined in a complex global payer environment and what factors influence the process. His insights will help a wide range of audiences, from healthcare industry professionals to policy makers and the broader public, to gain a better understanding of this highly complex and emotionally charged field. The Price of Global Health is recognized as a valued and unique reference book that covers a complete array of topics related to global pharmaceutical pricing. It contains an in-depth but straightforward exploration of the pharmaceutical pricing strategy process, its underlying market access, general business and ethical considerations, and its implications for payers, physicians and patients. It is a much-needed and invaluable resource for anybody interested or involved in, or affected by, the development, funding and use of prescription drugs. In particular, it is of critical importance to pharmaceutical company executives and other leaders and professionals in commercialization and drug development, including marketing, business development, market access and pricing, clinical development, drug discovery, regulatory affairs, health outcomes, market research and public affairs. The second edition includes new chapters on payer value story development, oncology, orphan drugs and payer negotiations. Furthermore, many country chapters have been substantially updated to reflect changes in the healthcare systems, including the Affordable Care Act in the US, AMNOG in Germany, medico-economic requirements in France and many other country-specific changes. Lastly, almost every chapter has been updated with new examples and illustrations. © Ed Schoonveld 2015. All rights reserved.","","Book","Scopus"

The author was motivated by Vincent Harlow’s commendable remark that much research needs to be done on the influence of Smith’s doctrines on the economic policy of British political leaders during the late eighteenth century. Hamilton attempts to achieve this through a study of the ideas of some thinkers who have thus far received scarce academic attention, and their influence on some of the pivotal political figures in the early American republic. He embraces Bailyn’s argument that earlyAmerican culture was mostly the result of further developing metropolitan Western European culture, not least in economic thought. Hume’s, Smith’s and Tucker’s ideas on political economy have remained under-analysed in recent biographies of John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. Still, the author posits, ‘the dialogue of ideas that the British thinkers exchanged with their American counterparts is imperative to understand how the new country positioned itself in relation to other nation-states’ (p. xvi). The pivotal figure in the book is Benjamin Vaughan (1751-1835), the influential private secretary of Lord Shelburne, while both men are singled out as major proponents of Smith’s ideas. By way of context, the book commences with an overview of the debate on trade in the eighteenth century, particularly the alleged dichotomy between laizzezfaire and mercantilist ‘reason of state’. It must be noted that, throughout the entire book, the author proceeds in a very fragmented way, apparently more informed by the content of his secondary literature, than the specific purpose of the book. So here, in just a few pages, he analyses Stewart’s biography of Smith, follows up with three French thinkers (Turgot, Gournay and d’Argenson) and continues with Jacob Viner and the role of the Christian tradition in the trade debate going back to the fourth-century pagan Libanius. Then, two German thinkers, Oberfohren and Rothkrug, are briefly introduced, before the argument returns to France with a focus on Belesbat and Boisguilbert. While all this is interesting, it fails to provide convincing evidence for the claim that ‘a genealogy of Smith’sWealth of Nations must necessarily include these French influences’ (p. 17). The reader longs for a more analytical approach, as for example provided by Douglas Irwin (1996), while it remains unclear why other participants in the trade debate in that period are excluded (for example those presented in Clark, 2003). From the second chapter onwards, Hamilton turns to Vaughan; in his words, ‘the essential yet overlooked figure’ in free-trade theories in the context of British colonial relations (p.23) and the ‘cosmopolitan staunch defender of the liberal system’who kept his back straight, while Smith and JohnAdams were ‘eventually pressed to reverse their free trade stances in the face of international trade sanctions’ (p. 24). The author starts with an account of the life of the second Lord Shelburne (William Petty). Petty’s brother was a lodger of Smith and he and Shelburne were lifelong friends, In Shelburne’s own words, Smith’s principles ‘constituted the happiness of my life’ (p. 31). Vaughan, as his confidential secretary, was a key figure in Shelburne’s circle from the 1770s onwards, while he was also a friend of Benjamin Franklin. Consequently, Vaughan acted as trusted friend of both sides during the Paris peace negotiations between America and Britain in 1782-1783. He tried hard to include articles guaranteeing free trade in the peace agreement, but failed. Shortly afterwards, he helped to prepare Shelburne’s speaking notes for his defence of the peace treaty in parliament but this also failed, leading to the latter’s fall as a prime minister. Vaughan then followed in his father’s footsteps as a politically active merchant. He continued to object to moves to limit trade; for example, the initiative to exclude the Americans from commerce with the British West Indies. Vaughan kept friendly relations with many important thinkers and activists in many countries, particularly in France. After the French revolution had escalated, Vaughan left Britain because he feared imprisonment in the wake of investigations into ‘revolutionary enthusiasts’. He ended up in Maine, USA, where he spend the last 35 years of his life as a politically influential land owner. Vaughan was the editor of Franklin’s collected writings and had a hand in the translation of Condorcet’s Vie de M. Turgot into English. His own writings mainly consisted of essays and letters; for example, advising Shelburne on the American question. In line with Turgot, he consistently emphasised the importance of free trade between Britain and the Americans. Although published anonymously, New and Old Principles of Trade (1788) was almost certainly written by Vaughan (p. 119-120). The essay was republished in 1859 in the collection, New and Old Principles of Trade, edited by the influential free trade supporter John Ramsay McCulloch. Vaughan’s brief treatise was, in the words of Hamilton, ŉot the earliest, yet the most perfect expression of laissez-faire, cosmopolitanism and benevolence before the French Revolution’ (p. 124). In it, Vaughan attacked mercantilism with the help of four conceptual tools. He attempted to show that all participating countries benefited from free trade (the rich country-poor country question) and that free trade fostered peace. He even believed in the beneficial effects of trade between belligerent neighbours. He provided arguments and examples to show that trade theory would work in practise, while he also used ‘providential arguments’, as Viner has called it, or the idea that God has purposely scattered the resources across the Earth to compel humans to cooperate through commerce. Together the treatise provided a fully cosmopolitan vision of the world. Hamilton follows Hirschmann in the argument that the eighteenth century wit- nessed a shift in thinking about colonial relations, from passion and power-based raison d’état, to an interest-based doux commerce, as Montesquieu has coined it. Here, the peace enhancing effects of international commercial relations were central. Hamilton also places Hume and Smith (p. 95) in this category. That is simply erroneous. Of course, both Hume and Smith highly valued trade for numerous reasons, not least economic and cultural. Yet they did not expect that increased commercial ties between nations would ensure or even just foster peace. Indeed, they pointed out that the increased wealth of nations as a result of free trade would go together with increased military capacity and that many causes of war remained (see Van de Haar 2009, 2010, 2013). While the author is not unique in making this mistake, it is symptomatic for the whole book. It lacks a yardstick for the selection of the numerous thinkers presented. It is only a short book, so there is no room for a sufficiently detailed analysis of their thought. This leads to a very scattered information flow. The author’s choice has clearly been to use a broad-brush approach to the history of ideas. That choice in itself is of course valid, yet becomes troublesome if the main questions of the book remain unanswered. To give the most prominent example: the author set out to analyse the practical influence of Adam Smith’s theories. Of course this demands a thorough knowledge of those theories, for which the author does not provide much evidence. The bibliography just lists the Hackett and Cannan versions of theWealth of Nations as primary sources, no other works of Smith are mentioned. Hence, the book does not qualify as a solid piece of Smith-related scholarship. This said, it is still of some interest to Smith scholars, as the author does succeed to draw attention to the interesting figure of Benjamin Vaughan. Vaughan was one of those almost forgotten yet influential contemporaries of Smith. The two men knew each other and like Shelburne, Vaughan attempted to bring Smith’s principles into practical policy making, particularly in the transatlantic context. His close ties with Franklin and his role during the peace negotiations make it worthwhile to get (re)acquainted with his life story and his writings on trade. The book offers an opportunity for this. © 2015 selection and editorial material, Fonna Forman.","","Book chapter","Scopus"

The goal of the game is to enable participants to experience how strategic and operational choices made in relation to innovation strategy are interrelated and how these choices can impact on new product development success. Specifically the paper aims to explore the impact of choices made in relation to capability accumulation, capacity management and product-portfolio management. Design/methodology/approach: After presenting the learning objectives for the game with the support of relevant literature, the paper describes the design of the game and the context in which it was played. The paper reviews feedback (learning outcomes) from formal reflective post-game sessions with participants. This feedback indicates that the learning objectives have been satisfied. Findings: Through experiential learning and reflective practice participants learn, for example, that: capabilities need to match the intended strategy; investing in production capacity can be leveraged to aid negotiations with competitors, or it can be used as a bully tactic; and, it sometimes is better to be an R&D ""follower"" rather than a ""leader"". The participants also learn that the alignment of operational and strategic choices is necessary in order to leverage success in developing new products but that the actions and strategies of competitors have a direct impact also and need to be considered carefully. Research limitations/implications: The teaching tool adopts a participative game playing and reflective learning approach to introduce into class some of the real-life competitive dynamics of managing new product development and decision making normally confined to the boardroom. While it is argued that the game demonstrates the challenges of developing successful strategy, the game is set in a static context in which certain external contingencies are not accounted for. Originality/value: Demonstration of the importance of strategy to new product development is particularly difficult because of the longitudinal nature of product development and the tacit nature of the decision making process which often transpires long after projects are completed. The paper posits that the value of the Innovation Game is in reflecting on it as a practical, interactive tool that helps participants appreciate the challenges inherent in strategic and operational decision making related to innovation strategy and new product development success. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Experiential learning; Games; Innovation","Article","Scopus"

Executive chefs should be skilled in both management and culinary arts, in addition to ensuring the success of the entire hospitality division. The study aims to understand the competencies of executive chefs in international tourist hotels in Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review and behavioral event interviews were conducted with ten executive chefs and executive sous chefs. The modified Delphi method verified the results using 15 experts. Findings: A competency framework was created, with four quadrants – managerial, operational, behaviors and skills – to classify executive chefs’ competencies. Each competency was further divided into sub-competencies – culinary research, emotional control, negotiation skills, job guidance and proactive thinking ability – for 25 items. Quadrants I and II are hard competencies that can be improved through education and training, whereas the third and fourth are soft competencies that require more time for development in workers. Practical implications: The two-step study developed a competency framework with a practical reference value. The study results could be utilized by human resources managers during their companies’ training, recruitment, selection and promotion. Originality/value: Besides the Delphi method, a deep behavioral event interview that enabled determining critical competencies was also used to collect data. The results obtained could be used to structure schools’ curricula. Collaborations between the hospitality industry and schools could help develop better curricula and training plans to maximize the availability of educational resources. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioral event interview; Competence; Competency; Dual ladder theory; Strategic human capital management; Strategic leaderships","Article","Scopus"

BASF, Dow Chemical and DuPont have worked to make environmental and health regulations on chemicals - such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) - more industry-friendly. The Bromine Science and Environmental Forum (BSEF) sought to prevent an EU ban on brominated flame retardants (BFRs). A key target for lobbyists is the European Commission, which proposes new legislation and controls the implementation of EU regulations. It also encourages firms to participate in collaborative research, using EU funds as an incentive. Leapfrog (Leadership for European Apparel Productions From Research along Original Guidelines), for example, aims to make technological breakthroughs in apparel manufacture. But most textile lobbyists in Brussels focus on EU trade policy, including: trade relations with leading textile exporting countries; the EU stance on the Doha Round; negotiations of bilateral free trade agreements; efforts to get better accees to markets in China and India; reforms of origin rules; and ""Made in"" labels for clothes imported into the EU. Other targets include the Council of Ministers and the Textile-Clothing committee within the European Parliament. Lobbying is also undertaken by Brussels-based industry associations such as Euratex (European Apparel and Textile Organisation), CIRFS (Comité International de la Rayonne et des Fibres Synthétiques), the European Association for Textile Polyolefins (EATP), the European Synthetic Turf Organisation (ESTO), the International Association Serving the Nonwovens and Related Industries (EDANA), and Eurocoton - which represents the cotton and allied textile industries in 11 EU countries and is known in Asia for its tough policy on anti-dumping. The International Wool Textile Organisation (IWTO), represents 4,000 wool and textile companies while the Asociación de Colectividades Textiles Europeas (ACTE) represents the interests of more than 70 territories with strong textile and fashion sectors in eight European countries. The Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry (RESI), meanwhile, defends European sports manufacturers' interests in Brussels and includes Asics, Diadora, Lotto, Nike, Puma, and Reebok among its members. Commerce associations include: the European Association of Fashion Retailers (AEDT); Eurocommerce, which represents the interests of companies engaged in retail, wholesale and international trade; and the Foreighn Trade Association (FTA), which campaigns for the free importation of goods into the EU, and fights protectionism outside Europe. The FTA has also established the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), which provides retail, importing and brand companies with a system for improving working conditions.

In examining the impact of the downturn on notions of business success, and contemplating potential scenarios for new measures of corporate value, it is proposed to examine the implications for business in adapting to the new economy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on Accenture's unrivalled access to business leaders around the world, both through work with leading multinational companies and a survey of over 800 global CEOs conducted on behalf of the United Nations Global Compact - the largest CEO study on sustainability to date. Findings: In the wake of the financial crisis, significant implications are seen for conceptions of corporate value creation. In examining four potential scenarios for the development of the new economy, it was found that changing notions of business success will demand new capabilities for companies. New skills will be required in creating, measuring and communicating value, from the mechanics of performance management and complex negotiations with stakeholders, often utilising new technologies (such as social networking). Originality/value: The paper, based on extensive conversations with an unprecedented set of leading global CEOs, posits a new conception of value creation for business in the new economy.

Our treatments vary the cost differences between firms in tiers 1 and 2. We measure how these underlying costs influence the efficiency, negotiated prices, and profit distribution across the supply chain, as well as the consistency of these outcomes with existing theory. We find that the structural issue of cost differentials dominates personal characteristics in explaining outcomes, with profits in a tier generally increasing with decreased competition in the tier and increasing with decreased competition in alternate tiers. The balanced principal model of supply chain bargaining does a good job explaining our data, and it outperforms the common assumption of leader-follower negotiations. We find a significant anchoring effect from a firm's first bid but no effect of the sequence of those bids, no evidence of failure to close via escalation of commitment, and mixed results for a deadline effect. We also find an interesting asymmetry between the buy and sell sides in employed bidding strategy. All firms make predominantly concessionary offers after the initial anchor; however, sell-side firms that engage in aggressive anticoncessionary bidding successfully increase prices while not compromising closure rates. Buy-side firms achieve much smaller price changes from anticoncessionary tactics and risk reduced closure, yielding no net benefit. © 2016 INFORMS.","Bargaining; Behavioral experiments; Efficiency and profitability; Multiechelon supply chains","Article","Scopus"

In this latter case, the resulting choices have implications with regard to both structure and behaviour, which defy all explanations that are based exclusively on the personalities of members or leaders. This approach provides a means of classifying and subdividing enclaves, and proposes, in so doing, a bimodal developmental schema with four forks, The first fork examines demographic security: it focuses on concerns regarding defection, and on the means of controlling information. The second considers internal organization, as well as alternatives to defection. The third fork, on external relations, looks into the alternative steps that are available in order to control factionalism and negotiations with the outside. Finally, the fourth fork explores the availability and control of resources (funds as well as military equipment), and the different effects these have on central vs. peripheral autonomy, as well as with regard to the nature of reconciliation. A close examination of how information is shaped by institutions shows that the behaviour and personal attitudes of enclavists are largely defined by the constraints imposed on the options that are available to them. It is not the personalities of members but these constraints that ultimately channel their understanding.","Defection; Enclaves; Factionalism; Information; Reconciliation; Terrorism","Review","Scopus"

Over the last two decades, the IWO psychology field in general has witnessed a dramatic upsurge in the development and testing of theories of work-related behaviour and the design of interventions with a cognitive emphasis. In the related areas of engineering psychology and ergonomics, for example, researchers have devoted considerable attention to an analysis of the nature and significance of employees' mental models of complex operating systems in terms of their impact on system performance while in the area of selection and assessment, attribution theory and other work from the field of social cognition have increasingly informed the analysis of personnel selection interviews. Cognitive theory and research have also been applied in an attempt to better understand the underlying bases of appraisers' judgments in the appraisal of performance. In the area of training and development, conventional approaches to the analysis, design, and evaluation of interventions are being augmented, and in some cases openly challenged, by the application of cognitive constructs, theories, and principles. Much recent theory and research relating to the topics of employee relations and motivation, organizational development and change, teamwork, leadership, organizational culture and climate, negotiation, group decision-making, stress, and personality and individual differences has also been decidedly cognitive in emphasis. This essay provides a selective overview of these developments, both in order to place in context the other contributions to this volume and in order to reflect more generally on the state of theory and research lying at the IWO-cognitive psychology interface.","","Article","Scopus"

It completed its post-Cold War strategy of ""multilateralizing"" its foreign policy by joining ASEAN, normalizing relations with the US, and signing a comprehensive framework agreement with the EU. All three are recognized as major accomplishments for modern Vietnamese diplomacy. However, in the EU-Vietnam framework agreement, Hanoi made an unprecedented concession when it agreed to the human rights clause in the treaty. For the very first time, Vietnam had accepted an explicit, legally binding stipulation on human rights in a bilateral treaty. This remarkable development resulted from the confluence of three major dynamics. First, Hanoi had committed itself to establish sound relations with all major economic centers-of-gravity at the time, ASEAN, the US, and the EU. Second, the EU also was keenly interested in stronger relations with Asian countries but was flexible about prioritizing any particular bilateral relationship. Third, Brussels' diplomats had to work off a treaty template when negotiating fundamental bilateral agreements. The standard EU framework agreement at the time included a human rights clause. In 1995, the EU was insisting that any treaty with Vietnam would have to include a clause on human rights. Initially, Hanoi rejected such a treaty provision, and the negotiations stalled. However, when Hanoi realized that Brussels felt no urgency to complete the treaty and was unable to compromise on human rights, Vietnam's leadership reconsidered. In order to complete the strategy of ""multilateralizing"" its international affairs, Vietnam had to accept the human rights clause in the treaty with the EU. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","","Article","Scopus"

Study Level This case is suitable to be used in advanced undergraduate and MBA/MSc level. Case Overview The case highlights the challenges of adopting the green concept by British Council Lahore. The British Council Lahore’s new Library aimed at providing modern twentieth-century library services to the educational community in Lahore was completed in August 2016 and became one of the earliest and highest rated Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Building Design and Construction (BD+C): new construction-certified building in Pakistan. The library building was a stellar outcome of design and innovation, rating high on water use reduction, energy efficiency, use of wastewater technology, sustainable site design, use of green materials and resources, high indoor environmental quality, and innovation. The architect was Raza Ali Dada, the lead architect and partner of the prestigious architectural firm Nayyar Ali Dada & Associates (NADA). It is January 2016, and he faces the problem of a serious impasse with the client (British Council) because of a difference of understanding safety and design priorities of the green project. This may be due to possible inaccurate assessment of component costs by NADA and be caused by the client’s inflexibility with security features of the building. Operational and stakeholder processes that assist and hinder the adoption of green building design in a country like Pakistan can be seen in play in the context. The impasses can, at worse, result in the loss of the entire business from the British Council, or at best, serious delays in project delivery, which would reflect very badly on NADA’s ability to handle construction projects. How can Raza proceed with the negotiations? How can the client be won over before the impasse turned into schedule delays that the firm could not afford? Expected Learning Outcomes The learning objectives of this case are as follows: • to introduce students to the “Green Building” concept and LEED certification and its various levels; • to highlight the operational and strategic processes that can assist the adoption of green infrastructure in Pakistan; and • to illustrate challenges associated with the adoption of responsible building design in emerging economies with constrained resources and poor awareness of the need for greener infrastructure among industry clients. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Architectural design; Client needs; Design briefing; Green buildings; LEED; Library","Book chapter","Scopus"

The EU is a key player in global institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and NATO. It continues to construct an emerging identity and project its values and interests throughout contemporary international relations. The capacity of the EU to both formulate and realise its goals, however, remains contested. Some scholars claim the EU's `soft power' attitude rivals that of the USA's `hard power' approach to international relations. Others view the EU as insufficiently able to produce a co-ordinated position to project upon global politics. Regardless of the position taken within this debate, the EU's relationship with its external partners has an increasingly important impact upon economic, political and security concerns on an international level. Trade negotiations, military interventions, democracy promotion, international development and responses to the global economic crisis have all witnessed the EU playing a central role. This has seen the EU become both a major force in contemporary institutions of global governance and a template for supranational governance that might influence other attempts to construct regional and global institutions. This volume brings together a collection of leading EU scholars to provide a state-of-the-art overview covering these and other debates relating to the EU's role in contemporary global governance. The Handbook is divided into four main sections: Part I: European studies and global governance - provides an overview and critical assessment of the leading theoretical approaches through which the EU's role in global governance has been addressed within the literature. Part II: Institutions - examines the role played by the key EU institutions in pursuing a role for the EU in contemporary international relations. Part III: Policy and issue areas - explores developments within particular policy sectors, assessing the different impact that the EU has had in different issue areas, including foreign and security policy, environmental policy, common commercial policy, the Common Agricultural Policy, development policy, accession policy, the Neighbourhood Policy and conflict transformation. Part IV: The global multilevel governance complex and the EU - focuses on the relationship between the EU and the institutions, regions and countries with which it forms a global multilevel governance complex, including chapters on the EU's relationship with the WTO, United Nations, East Asia, Africa and the USA. The editors are Jens-Uwe Wunderlich (Aston University) and David J. Bailey (University of Birmingham). Jens-Uwe Wunderlich's research and teaching focuses on international relations theory, European integration and globalization and on comparative regionalism; he has recently published Regionalism, Globalisation and International Order-Europe and Southeast Asia (Ashgate) and A Dictionary of Globalization (Routledge, 2007).

International air and marine travel have been left to one side in past talks because the pursuit of agreement proceeds on the basis of commitment by sovereign nations and the effects of these specific commercial activities are, by their nature, difficult to corral and assign to specific national jurisdictions. However, air travel is increasing and, unless something is done, emissions from this segment of our world economy will form a progressively larger percentage of the total, especially as emissions fall in other activities. This book focuses on fuel. The aim is to provide background in technical and policy terms, from the broadest reliable sources of information available, for the necessary discourse on society's reaction to the evolving aviation emissions profile. It considers what policy has been, why and how commercial air travel is committed to its current liquid fuel, how that fuel can be made without using fossil-source materials, and the barriers to change. It also advances some elements of policy remedies that make sense in providing an environmentally and economically sound way forward in a context that comprehends a more complete vision of sustainability than ‘renewable fuels’ traditionally have. The goal of Will Sustainability Fly? is to broaden and contextualize the knowledge resource available to academics, policy makers, air industry leaders and stakeholders, and interested members of the public. © Walter J.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a mixed-methods explanatory design. Data were collected from 44 teams directly following participation in the Everest Leadership and Team Simulation. Teams were assigned a specific mode of communication: virtual (text-chat only), face-to-face (FTF) or dual (FTF and chat). Findings: No significant differences in team goals achieved were found when comparing dual modes to single modes, counter to predictions based on MST. Qualitative data indicated that FTF communication is dominant and might lead to “medium inertia” when multiple modes are available. FTF teams reported higher perceptions of team effectiveness than text-chat-only teams. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted on a small number of teams in an artificial environment; therefore, generalizability is limited. Future research should consider other measures of team performance and test teams in a virtual setting where distance, as well as time, are factors. Practical implications: FTF communication tends to be dominant to a point where virtual options are ignored, suggesting that greater awareness around communication processes required for complex tasks, and ways to appropriate different media for conveyance or convergence, is key to team performance.

When the Pan-PRD Cooperative Framework was created (Pan-Pearl River Delta 2005), it was premised in part on the conviction that the vastly different resource endowments and levels of economic development of its constituent parts could be dovetailed in a complementary fashion to advance the flow of people, goods, capital, information and all the factors of production. Indeed, Table 9.1 sheds light on the sharp contrasts among the provinces in selected indicators. The largest province in area, Sichuan, is more than fourteen times the size of the island province of Hainan; the most populous province, Guangdong, has at least eleven times the population of Hainan; and per capita GDP in Guangdong and Fujian is at least twice as high as in any other province. The special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macao are shown to be tiny in terms of population and area, but they are economic heavyweights with per capita GDP that is eight or nine times that of both Guangdong and Fujian, the leaders among the provinces. The sharp contrast between the two SARs and the nine provinces is also revealed in their overwhelming reliance on the tertiary sector for economic sustenance. From the outset, infrastructure was rightly identified as the vehicle to advance economic development and minimize regional disparity within the Pan-PRD. Of the 10 domains selected for cooperation, infrastructure was a top priority. 'Strengthening coordination in infrastructure development' is viewed as one of four requirements spelled out in the cooperation document. Infrastructure development is viewed as a highly efficient and effective tool in breaking the logjam created by a regional structure fractured along the cellular lines of provincial boundaries (Zhang 2008). Recent studies supported by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank havesubstantiated the thesis that infrastructure development is regarded as 'wheels' of economic activity. In addition to generating economic and social benefits, it can support rural and regional development and reduce poverty and regional disparity (World Bank 1994; Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Finance 2002). In reality, even before the existence of the Pan-PRD, much had been achieved in infrastructure development within the new regional grouping. The administrative restructuring of port management in Fujian and the decentralization of airport management following the 2002 civil aviation reform are two important systematic changes made to rationalize and improve infrastructure development (Yeung and Kee 2007: 128, 138-40). That there is considerable room for improvement in and changes to the present system strongly suggests that infrastructure supply lags far behind demand. For instance, annual average growth rates in passenger traffic (6.57 per cent) and freight traffic (8.21 per cent) within the Pan-PRD from 2001 to 2006 were far below those seen in regional GDP (15.51 per cent) and national gross industrial output (26.71 per cent) (National Statistics Bureau [hereafter NSB] 2002, 2007). The gap between supply and demand is huge. In recent infrastructure development within the Pan-PRD, the objectives of linking coastal and inland areas, urban and rural districts, and leading and lagging parts of the federation together form a central rationale for the targeting of development. The newly completed expressway between Chongqing and Guangdong is likely to promote the development of the logistics industry in southwest China. Similarly, the high-speed rail link between Guiyang and Guangzhou recently proposed by Lin Shusen, Governor of Guizhou, and endorsed by the central authorities, is seen as an amenity that will vastly increase the tempo of Guizhou's economic development. The recent breakthrough made in securing an agreement to build the Hong Kong- Zhuhai-Macao Bridge after years of intensive discussions and dialogue is again widely welcomed as a means of hastening development in the western wing of the Pearl River Delta, an area which has long been deprived of the positive spinoff effects of the Hong Kong economy. In the same way, the west-east power transmission grid will boost the power supply in Guangdong with the growth of the electricity generation and construction industries in Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi, a change that will benefit both regions. As alluded to earlier, the different administrative positions of the various spatial units within the Pan-PRD have posed challenges to infrastructure development, especially where they involve customs formalities and border control. The two SARs of Hong Kong and Macao and the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) of Shenzhen and Zhuhai, along with the nine provinces, all have to follow specific protocols in the negotiation of major infrastructure development projects. These political and administrative differences have often delayed the implementation of infrastructure projects, notwithstanding the outstanding proposals made over the course of many years. The bridge project spanning the two sides of the Pearl River Delta estuary is a prime example of this. Be that as it may, much progress has been made within the Pan-PRD across a broad spectrum of infrastructure development, as the next section will show. © 2011 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

The reasons for this vary. Sometimes the parties think that “time is on their side”—that continuing the battle will benefit them. Other times, leaders worry how they will appear in the eyes of their own followers if they seem to have lost heart or are ready to give in. A third reason that parties may not initiate talks is their concern that a willingness to do so may lead the other side to assume that they are ready to give up. This article examines a new way of helping parties move forward in such situations using what is called “breakthrough collaboration,” an idea invented by the Consensus Building Institute. Breakthrough collaboration allows parties to take advantage of a critical moment to initiate preliminary trust-building activities, share information and send messages through a neutral party, and engage in internal efforts that can make it easier to move toward joint problem-solving. Such efforts can be triggered by a convener (who is not a party) and assisted by a mediator (who may not meet with the parties simultaneously). The goal is to do more than merely encourage dialogue. The hope is that an extended sequence of facilitated activities or events can lead to a shift in thinking on all sides. The key is to know when a critical moment creates an opportunity for breakthrough collaboration. © 2020 President and Fellows of Harvard College","breakthrough collaboration; critical moments; mediation; negotiation","Article","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach – A new conceptual framework for experiential learning that draws on both scholarly and experimental learning. Using learner-centred learning, the approach aims to engage each student to act both as a learner and a mentor, thus empowering them into enhancing their own and the overall class’ learning experience. Findings – Applying the diversity of students’ individual cultural mindsets to analyse and critically evaluate some of the current most pressing organizational and national/international dilemmas in sustainability. The preliminary outcomes seem to indicate that this approach enriches the students’ learning experience and motivates them to become reflective practitioners and sustainability-focused leaders in their future organizational roles. Research limitations/implications – A framework for an empirical mapping of this important area of teaching and learning (T&L) aimed at a highly international body of undergraduate management students. This is currently under-represented in academic writing and practice, as most of the comparable situations so far mainly address post-graduate cases and do not reflect on the international diversity of the student body. Practical implications – This research reflects on the importance of embedding diverse views on the same issues based on different cultural and socio-economic perspectives, and therefore it brings value to the students’ experience in view of enhancing their global and international human relations awareness and negotiation skills in view of more meaningful sustainability-focused plans and actions. Social implications – Students become aware of differences in needs, resources, cultural perceptions, business standards, practices and policies in place in different countries, and they will be committed to embedding sustainability issues in their future life as business practitioners and will be able to ensure the most appropriate business responses to a planet and humanity under pressure. Originality/value – A rather innovative T&L approach to embed sustainability issues in undergraduate management students training in a highly international context. This is currently under-represented in academic writing and practice, in spite of the numerous programmes that nowadays bring students from all over the world to study together at higher education/university undergraduate level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cross-cultural management; Developing countries; Diversity management; Experiential learning; Higher education; Management development","Article","Scopus"

Design/methodology/approach: As well as reviewing extant literature in order to provide historical background, the paper draws upon original analysis of the series of biennial TUC Equality Audits, the latest SERTUC equality survey and interviews with national union officers responsible for equality in large-, medium- and small-sized unions. Findings: Over the last 50 years, unions have made considerable progress in representing women both in leadership and democratic structures as well as in the workplace bargaining and consultative arena. However, BAME members remain underrepresented in both domains. A hostile socio-economic/political context threatens to hinder further progress. Research limitations/implications: It is quite clear that the authors cannot assess unions’ current record on equality by reference only to outcomes and benefits of big set-piece organisation, industry or sector negotiations. Future research could usefully explore in more depth unions’ qualitative contribution to workplace equality practices in context of challenges in the internal and external environments. Practical implications: Unions need to step up commitment to integrating equality into the bargaining agenda. They also need to continue investing in campaigning activities and identify ways of making successful outcomes more visible within the union, to members and to non-unionised workers. Workplace unions need to develop strategies to confront the fact that strong equality policies do not necessarily translate into good workplace practices. Originality/value: The paper provides a long-term evaluation of union progress on equality within the movement itself and the workplace. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collective bargaining; Equality; Gender; Trade unions","Article","Scopus"

Starting from the Seoul summit, G-20 leaders sought to make a transition from responding to a contingent situation to deal with the structural problems of the world economy. These included the problems of development, IMF reforms, international reserve currency and financial regulation. G-20 summit deliberations since then have not led to any significant progress in any of these areas. Objectives and policy measures agreed upon in almost all major areas of concern to G-20 are platitudinous in nature, having little operational significance. Moreover, they are couched in terms which makes it impossible to hold any government accountable for success or failure. G-20 has a very tenuous legal justification to play the role assigned to it. A vast majority of the members of the United Nations are outside it. Besides, given the composition of the G-20, emerging economies like India, China, and Brazil cannot in any effective manner that influence the outcome of G-20 deliberations. G-20 represents a significant institutionalization of the ongoing process of the erosion of the economic functions of the United Nations. In view of the above, interests of India, Brazil and other emerging economies can be best served through cooperation within the United Nations. However, the G-20 in its new role is firmly established and is likely to remain active in the near future. Therefore, a principal challenge for countries like India is to seek to reconcile their role in the wider forums of the United Nations with that in the G-20. © 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Yet, how PCMHs can accomplish this coordination is not well understood. Purpose: Drawing upon organizational theory (Galbraith, 1974; Mintzberg, 1980; Thompson, 1967), we explored how PCMHs use coordination mechanisms to build and optimize their medical neighborhoods. Methodology: We used mixed methods, blending data collected via interviews and surveys with practice leaders and care coordinators at 30 months after a PCMH collaborative intervention in Colorado as well as surveys from all providers from 13 PCMHs before and 30 months after the intervention. We used thematic analysis to understand the role and use of coordination mechanisms by PCMHs and changes in the ability to coordinate and deliver care continuity. Findings: PCMHs drew on four coordination mechanisms to build relationships with their medical neighbors: interorganizational routines to improve reliability of information flow; information connectivity to facilitate continuity and safe care; boundary spanners to integrate care across silos; and communication, negotiation, and decision mechanisms to introduce shared accountability. When providers were fairly confident of the patient's diagnosis and management required sequential interactions (such as tests or procedures), PCMHs tended to coordinate care through interorganizational routines and information connectivity.When a diagnosiswas less certain.

In recent years, much of the attention of economists and policy analysts interested in Asia has been focused on East Asia. This is perhaps because East Asia has been outward oriented for much longer and has also been exceptionally successful economically. But now that South Asia has begun to open up in a big way, it is time to take a closer look at it. Though substantial differences exist across the four countries under consideration, broadly speaking, all of them have undertaken very substantial trade reforms during the 1990s. In Sri Lanka which is at present the most open of these economies, the average tariff rate has gone down from the 20-25 per cent range to 10 per cent in 1991. In India, which is the least open among the region's economies, the share of manufacturing value added protected by non-tariff barriers (NTBs) has gone down from 90 per cent at the beginning of 1991 to 36 per cent by mid-1995. The highest tariff in the country has come down from 340 per cent in 1991 to 40 per cent in 1997? In Section 2, I summarise the steps towards trade liberalisation taken in the region during the last decade. Both tariff and non-tariff barriers are discussed. In Section 3, I take up the future trade policy agenda. A distinguishing feature of this section is that, in addition to addressing issues of immediate interest, it offers a perspective on longer-term issues. Preoccupied by matters facing them immediately, the region's leaders have often failed to formulate long-term strategies and have, as a result, failed to negotiate effectively in the multilateral negotiations. The discussion in this section, therefore, attempts to draw attention towards long-term issues. The paper is concluded in Section 4.","","Article","Scopus"

More specifically, we explore why and how, a supplier and retailer would want to shift the locus of integration from the dyadic to the network level by adding a third party to an ongoing relationship. A case study is developed to analyze the process of integration in the context of category management programs. The analysis reports on a program developed by a regional retailing chain based in the south of Italy, with the collaboration of a national coffee blends supplier and a third-party leader in the market analysis service business. The findings offer a novel view of third parties' role, which broadens the scope from a typical, initial support of negotiations to an evolving modality of intervention during the different phases of the collaborative project. More precisely, the third party enables the sequential and joint activation of alternative forms of interaction between the parties, which is pivotal for enacting the integration mechanism that is most suitable for each program phase. These findings offer a rich set of insights for the analysis of integration within distribution channel and supply chains, as well as for category management and, more generally, for knowledge management in marketing relationships. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.
